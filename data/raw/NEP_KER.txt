Kerala Flood 2018 and the Socio-Economic Deprivation of
Households in Alappuzha District
Lavanya Sivan1
 and Anitha V.2
Abstract
Kerala faced unforeseen floods in August 2018, which simultaneously affected natural
and human resources. The impact of floods on households, particularly in the coastal
area of the Alappuzha district, was very high. The main focus of this paper is to assess
the socioeconomic deprivation of households in the Pampa River basin of the Pandanad
panchayat of Alappuzha district. This study discusses the causes and effects of the flood
and the unique recovery strategy of the state. The socio-economic deprivation index
of flood-affected households is estimated by taking the arithmetic mean of the three
indices, such as the health domain index (HDI), the economic domain index (EDI), and
the standard of living index (SDI). Each dimension is calculated based on the general
formula that UNDP used to calculate the Human Development Index. This empirical
study found that most of the households in the study area have come in the high
socio-economic deprivation category in the post-flood scenario.

1. Introduction
Globally, flooding is the most dangerous disaster for economic loss and human
fatalities. During the last decade of the 20th century, floods washed out 100,00 lives and
impacted more than 1.4 billion people (Jonakman, 2005). A study by Parvin et al. (2016)
among the rural poor in Bangladesh, reveals that the floods increase their vulnerability
leading to joblessness and depletion of their income and resources. Khayyam (2020)

surveyed the northwest region of Pakistan and found that floods significantly impact
the economic and livelihood impact of the rural poor. The flood destroyed their
agriculture and livestock, which led them into poverty syndrome by washing out
their savings and forcing them to borrow money.
The causes behind floods are heavy rainfall in the monsoon period, cyclones, cloud
bursting, tsunamis, outbursts of glacial lakes, urbanisation, unauthorised construction,
river bank erosion, sedimentation of channel beds, inefficient rivers, reservoirs, and
drainage management (Tripathi, 2015; Mohanty et al., 2020; Parida, 2020). Floods
have both social and economic impacts, such as the loss of people’s lives, private and
public property damage and agricultural land and crop destruction (Parida, 2020).
Floods constitute 84% of fatalities among India's 10 most significant disasters from
2005 to 2014. Riverine floods are the most common type of floods in India, followed
by flash floods and coastal floods (Tripathi, 2015). Socio-hydro climatological variables
complicate flood control in India by affecting the severity and frequency of flood
occurrences. Factors like climate change, rising sea levels, and socioeconomic dynamics
hamper flood management, resulting in significant socioeconomic losses and fatalities,
despite substantial expenditure and ongoing flood-control initiatives throughout the
nation (Mohanty et al., 2020). The central and state governments relationship is crucial
for effective disaster management and economic development, as it enhances the
efficiency of funding and support during disasters (Parida, 2020).
Recently the occurrence of floods is common across India (Narayanan, 2022),
particularly in Kerala. After a hundred years, Kerala experienced a severe flood
in 2018. In 2019 also, the state witnessed a flood that affected 1038 villages from
13 districts, 21264 houses were fully or severely damaged, and 125 people lost their
lives (Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, 2019). Flood is a common
phenomenon in coastal areas of the Alappuzha district of Kerala due to its topographical
structure and people adapted to some extent (Santhi & Veerakumaran, 2019). However,
the 2018 flood is unexpected and affects other parts of the state. The socioeconomic
deprivation of people is entirely different as compared to the usual one. This paper
tried to analyse the socio-economic deprivation of households in Pandanad
panchayat of the Alappuzha district in the context of the Kerala flood of 2018.
Kerala Flood 2018 and the Socio-Economic Deprivation of Households in Alappuzha District
Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 3
According to the Global Data Lab of Radboud University (2021), the state had the
highest HDI of 0.782 in 2019, comparable to developed countries. The socio-economic
characteristics such as health, education, and living standards helped the state
achieve this top position. The Kerala flood of 2018 severely threatened the state’s
socio-economic and human development. That led Kerala into a socially and
economically worse situation. Human deprivation is a lack of human capabilities,
opportunities, choices, values, and basic needs such as food, shelter, education,
clothing, health etc. (Sivakumar & Sarvalingam, 2010). Natural disasters like floods
severely impact these variables, indispensable to human development. Hence, it
is necessary to assess the changes in the socio-economic variables and the level of
deprivation to develop suitable policies to overcome the future impact of floods.
The paper is organised into different sections. The second section explained the
data and research methods of the study. It is followed by the analysis of socio-economic
effects, government actions, and the recovery strategies of the state of Kerala flood
in 2018. The final section concludes the whole study with policy recommendations.
2. Data and Methods
Among the 14 districts of Kerala, Alappuzha (popularly known as Alleppey) district
is the smallest in terms of geographical area. The district’s geographical speciality is
that it lies on the coastal plain of the Arabian Sea and is the only district without forest
cover. Kuttand, renowned as the ‘Rice Bowl of Kerala,’ is situated in this district and
is the only location globally where farming occurs up to two meters below sea level.
The state has two monsoon seasons: namely, southwest monsoon from June to
September and northeast monsoon from October to November. Alleppey is renowned
globally for its water tourism. The word ‘Alappuzha’ consists of two words: ‘ala’ and
‘puzha’. In Malayalam, ‘ala’ means broad and ‘puzha’ means river. Due to the extensive
network of canals and backwaters, this district is known as ‘the Venice of the East’. The
existence of rivers, lakes and other aquatic bodies makes the region the most susceptible
to flooding in the state (District Disaster Management Authority, Alappuzha, 2015).
The rivers flowing through Alappuzha district are Pampa, Manimala, and
Achankovil. The Thottappilly Spillway in Vembanad Lake receives water from these
rivers. Furthermore, of all the principal rivers, only the Pampa River is regulated
Lavanya Sivan, Anitha V.
4 Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024
by the Kakki dam. The Pampa River, Kerala’s third longest river, enters Alappuzha
at Chengannur taluk and travels through Pandanad, Veeyapuram, Thakazhi, and
Champakulam regions over a distance of about 177.08 km, and culminates in
Vembanad Lake via multiple branches (District Disaster Management Authority,
Alappuzha, 2015; Santhi & Veerakumaran, 2019).
Both primary and secondary data were used for the study. An extensive household
survey was conducted in Pandanad panchayat, a rural local body, in the Chengannur
taluk of Alappuzha district to gather primary data. A significant portion of the
Pandanad panchayat is located on the banks of the Pampa River. Agriculture is the
main economic activity in this area. Therefore, climate change significantly influences
the livelihood of the people. The total area of the panchayat is 10.45 cm2
, and the
density of the population is 1276.74. The total number of households is 4285,
having a population of 13342. In this study, the flood-affected households were the
sampling units. Among the 13 wards in Pandanad panchayat, the most flood-affected
area, ward number two, was selected for the household survey. This ward is situated
along the banks of the River Pampa, and all the households inside it were impacted
by the floods. The strategy of selecting households at regular intervals was deemed
a more effective approach in this context. Out of the 349 households in ward
number two, 50 were selected through systematic sampling.
Secondary data were collected from the Post Disaster Needs Assessment
conducted by UN agencies and various government reports from the Central Water
Commission, Ministry of Earth Science, and Kerala State Disaster Management
Authority.
Floods resulted in the loss of materials, money and lives, which directly affected
socioeconomic deprivation. Deprivation of the households is assessed based on
the socio-economic conditions of the households in connection with floods. The
significant variables used in this study were loss of materials such as food grains,
home appliances, vital documents, vehicles, jewellery, cash, agricultural products, and
poultry, damage to houses and wells, sources of drinking water, occupation before and
after the flood, income, health expenditure, the amount spent to clean the house after
the flood, financial aid from the government and satisfaction level. A few variables are
Kerala Flood 2018 and the Socio-Economic Deprivation of Households in Alappuzha District
Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 5
used from the questionnaire on the Eviction Impact Assessment Tool developed by the
Housing and Land Rights Network, which is based on the UN Basic Principles and
Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement (2007).
In the context of the measurement of socioeconomic deprivation, the Human
Development Index (HDI) is considered the primary key indicator. The three
dimensions of the deprivation index include health, economic domain, and standard
of living (Pampalon & Raymond, 2000; Sivakumar & Sarvalingam, 2010; Lamnisos
et al., 2019; Kiran, 2021). Here health aspects are measured through mental and
physical health; economic dimensions through income and livelihood of the household;
and standard of living through drinking water, housing, electricity, and assets.
The general formula used by the UNDP for calculating human development is used
to calculate each deprivation index (United Nations, 2021). As such
Deprivation Index = (actual value-minimum value)
(maximum value-minimum value)
For getting the indices such as health domain index (HDI), economic domain index
(EDI) and standard of living index (SDI), the arithmetic mean of variables under each
dimension is calculated. Then for the socio-economic deprivation index (SEDI), the
arithmetic mean of the three is calculated. That is,
SEDI = (HDI+EDI+SDI)
3
The values range from 0 to 1, where 0 means the lowest and 1 means the highest
deprivation. High, low, and medium values are below 0.33, 0.34 to 0.66, and 0.67 to 1,
respectively.
3. The Kerala Flood 2018
In 1907 the state of Kerala witnessed the highest rainfall. Till August 2, the rainfall
has been 780 mm which was 150 per cent higher than the normal average. Kerala
experienced the highest rainfall in 1924 (3368 mm), whichever happened before.
Almost all parts of Kerala were flooded due to the high rainfall and more than 1000
people died (Khelkar, 2018; Kondapally et al., 2020). After 1924, Kerala experienced the
Lavanya Sivan, Anitha V.
6 Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024
worst flood in August 2018. This is because of the rains that have been halted for days.
The rainfall in Kerala is controlled by southwest and northeast monsoons. The annual
average rainfall in Kerala was 3000 mm (Central Water Commission, 2018). According
to Indian Meteorological Department data (2018), from 1st June 2018 to 19th August
2018, Kerala received 2346.6 mm of rainfall instead of the expected 1649.5 mm. The
rainfall over Kerala during June, July, and 1st to 19th of August was 15%, 18% and
164%, respectively, above the normal average. The state possesses 57 large dams.
Major reservoirs in Kerala had above 90 per cent of their capacity in August 2018
(Shaharban & Rathnakaran, 2019). Hence, the release of water from reservoirs was
essential. On August 15th, most reservoirs became near total capacity and 37 dams
were opened (Government of India, 2018; Kondapally et al., 2020).
3.1 Causes of the Flood
The primary causes behind the Kerala flood of 2018 can be divided into natural
causes and anthropogenic causes. The natural factors that influenced the flood were
the low-pressure system which formed in the Bay of Bengal (Hunt & Menon, 2020),
landslides, climate change and global warming (Kumar et al., 2020; Vanamaet al.,
2021). The anthropogenic causes were inefficient dam management (Kondapally
et al., 2020; Sudheer et al., 2019), extensive quarrying and mining in the Western Ghats,
illegal encroachment of forest land, developmental activities on the ecologically
sensitive zones as part of tourism, absence of proper drainage system and unscientific
use of land (Central Water Commission, 2018; Government of Kerala, 2018; Sudheer
et al., 2019). Excessive human encroachments in ecologically sensitive areas like the
Western Ghats worsened the situation. The Gadgil report (Government of India,
2011) highlighted that many reservoirs, especially in the steep valleys, are silting up
prematurely due to the massive encroachment and deforestation of catchments
consequent to dam construction. This report warned about landslides from the
ecologically sensitive areas in the Western Ghats due to the increased mining
and quarrying.
The Special Centre for Disaster Research of Jawaharlal Nehru University submitted a
report citing heavy rainfall, inefficient dam management, environmental degradation,
infrastructural development, and a lack of preparedness as the causes of the 2018
Kerala flood. This report criticised the performance of the Kerala State Disaster
Kerala Flood 2018 and the Socio-Economic Deprivation of Households in Alappuzha District
Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 7
Management Authority (KSDMA) on several grounds. The KSDMA was found to
have failed to ensure effective coordination and communication among various
departments, failed to update disaster management plans on time, had a poorly
functioning early warning system, and the fund utilisation was also not effective.
This report also criticised the state government for neglecting the recommendations
of the Gadgil's report. The government focused more on profit-making through
electricity generation than the safety of the people in dam management (Singh
et al., 2018).
3.2 Socio-economic Effects of the Kerala Flood 2018
The unexpected flood and landslides in Kerala affected 5.4 million people, 2 million
people were displaced, and more than 400 people lost their lives. The non-stopped
torrential rainfall leads to 341 landslides in this small state. The worst affected districts
were Idukki, Wayanad, Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Thrissur.
Due to the flood, close to 14 lakh people evacuated to relief camps as their homes
were flooded. According to the post-disaster needs assessment, the entire economic
loss from the 2018 flood was 26,720 crores of rupees (Government of Kerala, 2018).
Natural disasters have diverse economic impacts across economic sectors
depending on the disaster type and intensity (Panwar & Sen., 2019). The flood and
landslides caused severe damage to houses, and infrastructural facilities like bridges,
railways, roads, communication networks and power supplies. About 13,362 houses
were fully damaged; more than one lakh houses were severely damaged. Nearly 25 lakhs
of electricity connections were disrupted. More than 300 bridges and approximately
50,000-kilometre roads collapsed. Access to drinking water was disrupted for 20% of
the state’s population. Around 3,17,000 shallow wells and over 95,000 latrines
were substantially damaged. In the case of the agricultural sector, about 59,345.37
hectares of crops and livestock were washed away, and 3 lakh farmers were
affected. The total agricultural loss exceeded 1300 crores of rupees. Many private
properties, including business units, shops, showrooms, vehicles, schools and
hospitals, were damaged. The primary workforce in Kerala, such as agricultural
labourers, construction workers and workers in micro, small and medium enterprises,
had a wage loss of 45 days or more (Government of Kerala, 2018).

Over 1.75 lakh buildings have been damaged either fully or partially. The households
in the affected area lose their electronics, clothes, utensils, beds, certificates, property
documents and other valuable things within hours. The children lose their study
materials, bags, and uniforms. Students from classes X and XII are anxious due to the
loss of books and notes, which may affect their learning. Owing to the loss of families,
friends, neighbourhoods and properties, many people faced trauma and stress.
The houses, vehicles, jewellery etc., are the result of many years of hard work for each
one of them. Workers from the informal sector were the worst affected victims of the
flood. Households are the major consumption unit and a source of savings as far
as an economy is concerned. The flood slows the economy for over a month
(Government of Kerala, 2018).
3.3 Immediate Action Taken by the Government
The state government of Kerala immediately responded to the situation with rescue
operations. The mobilisation of forces such as the Coast Guard, National Disaster
Response Force, Kerala Fire and Rescue Services, Army, Navy, Air Force, Central
Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force, and fishing community of the state saved
many lives. About 15 lakh people have been moved to camps and relatives’ houses.
More than 1700 schools, worship centres, colleges, and other institutions were used
as relief camps. More than 10000 camps were opened (Government of Kerala, 2018).
The people of Kerala have overcome the unexpected natural calamity with perfect
determination. The Kerala youth restlessly worked for the rescue of flood victims
without any discrimination in the form of religion, caste, wealth and politics. To
disseminate government instructions and speed up rescue operations, social media
played an important role. The fishermen in Kerala deserve special gratitude for their
timely intervention in rescuing those trapped in flooded areas (Government of Kerala,
2018). The army's rescue team could not reach all flood-affected locations, particularly
in river basins, due to the overflowing of floodwater, whirlpools, large trees, and large
walls. However, the fishermen overcame these challenges to rescue the lives of children,
pregnant women, and the elderly. Because of these courageous actions, the Chief
Minister of Kerala described the fishermen as the ‘Army of Kerala’(Dhanya, 2019).

Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 9
3.4 Recovery Strategy of the State
Under the guidance of the state and the local government institutions, other
organisations and civil society, Kerala conducted a massive drive to clean floodaffected houses and wells and supply essential commodities and medicines. Various
organisations and individuals helped the flood victims clean their houses to ensure
basic needs like water, food grains, clothing, medicines, footwear etc. About 6,93,287
mud-coughed houses were cleaned, and about 14,657 dead bodies of the creatures
were buried. About 25 lakhs of power supply connections were restored quickly
(Government of Kerala, 2018).
The floodwaters contained sewage, dead bodies of birds and animals, and other
contaminants, which increased the risk of infectious diseases. Nonetheless, no
contagious diseases were reported in Kerala. However, the fact that no epidemics have
been detected in Kerala due to this flood has astounded the entire world. This resulted
from the door-to-door work of the efficient health workers in Kerala (Venu, 2019).
The central government, foreign countries, non-residential Indians, film stars,
business people, various organisations, and many individuals, especially ordinary
citizens, contributed to the chief minister's relief fund (Thummarukudy, 2019).
This support helped the government to speed up post-flood relief activities.
The government of Kerala provides immediate relief in cash and kind. About 7,37,484
flood-affected families received 10,000 rupees immediately as financial support. The
state also allow an additional 5000 rupees to SC/ ST families. The government provided
financial aid to damaged houses in Kerala. Households from the economically backward
class received food grains for three months through supply co. The authorities ensured
interest-free loans up to rupees 1 lakh through Kudumbasree to the flood affected to
refurbish their houses. The flood victims also got relaxation to pay the electricity bill
for four months. The labourers included in the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme got extra working days of 150 days. About three lakh farmers in
flood-affected areas benefited from 200 crores of rupees as financial support against
losing their crops. Around 21.70 crores of rupees were given to 27363 families who lost
their animals in the flood (Government of Kerala, 2018). Furthermore, the government
immediately provided duplicate certificates, property documents, ration cards, and
identity cards to those who had misplaced them (Venu, 2019).

10 Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024
The psychological impact of the 2018 flood on the people of Kerala was crucial.
The unexpected flood spontaneously washed out their relatives, friends, neighbours,
animals, land, buildings, vital documents and other earnings of a lifetime. Hence, to
recover the flood victims from the mental shock, the state government introduced a
project known as "PARIRAKSHA". This project was designed to support flood-affected
people, especially low-income people. The main focus of this project is to reduce
the long-term psychological impact of the disaster. This project covered two million
people from 93 severely flood-affected panchayats in Kerala. Accredited Social Health
Activists have been used for earlier identification of individuals with psychological
problems in the affected zones. This project started in March 2019, and due to
the outbreak of COVID-19, the activities of PARIRAKSHA have been interrupted
(Kiran et al., 2019).
4. Results and Discussion
Out of the 50 sample households, fifty per cent are Hindus, and fifty per cent are
Christians. It is noteworthy that irrespective of religion and caste, the people of
Kerala faced the flood together without any discrimination. More than 70 per cent
of the respondents said that their interaction with neighbours improved after the
flood. For almost two weeks, they cohabited and assisted one another. The presence
of relatives, friends, political representatives, officials, and neighbours offered
psychological assistance throughout the flood. Due to the overflow of the River
Pampa and the heavy rainfall, more than 75 per cent of the households could not reach
relief camps. For around 14 days, they stayed on the terrace with their neighbours.
During that period, they felt insecurity and stress, among them, few respondents,
especially the aged, had not recovered from the mental stress yet. The average size
of the family is 4.4. The age-wise classification shows that the majority of the people
were adults. They played a significant role in the rescue operations during the flood.
The family’s average monthly income is Rs. 27130.4, and the per capita income is
Rs.73992/- which is less than half of the state per capita income of Rs. 245,323
(Planning Board, 2021). The working population in the study area included fisher
folks, drivers, farmers, sales executives, MNREGA workers, and painters. The flood
affected their working days. On account of the psychological and financial impact
of the flood, they were unable to do work for more than a month.

Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 11
Agriculture is one of the major sources of livelihood for most of the households
in the study area. Fifty-four per cent of the households lost agricultural products,
and 22 per cent lost poultry in flood. The total loss of this sector was Rs. 630200. The
respondents had received compensation from the government, but the amount was
not sufficient for them. Another effect of the 2018 flood is identified in the case of
drinking water. In the pre-flood period, households in the study area depended on the
Pampa River, wells and public taps for drinking water, and they did not spend money
on drinking water. But, during the flood, almost all the wells were submerged in the
floodwaters, and the toilet wastes contaminated drinking water sources. Due to that,
20 per cent of the families started to pay for drinking water.
Following the calamity, the state government provided flood-affected households
with necessary food grain kits worth Rs 500 per month. More than fifty per cent of the
respondents got this kit of food grains for three months. That was excellent support
from the government, particularly to low-income families. Moreover, other
organisations and individuals also distributed essential goods to the flood-affected
people. To replace the damaged home appliances in flood, the State government
developed a plan to provide loans of up to one lakh to each family through
commercial banks. This loan amount was distributed through Kudumbashree.
Among the respondents, 18 per cent of the total households took those loans, and
others were not interested in raising their debt after the flood.
Figure 1: Number of years living in Pandanad
Figure 1 depicts that comparatively, more families have lived in Pandanad panchayat
for 20 to 40 years. Eight per cent of the households have lived here for generations.

In their opinion, this was the first time such a flood had occurred, and they hadn't
had any previous experience facing this kind of disaster. Because of the fear of future
flooding, many of them started thinking about shifting to other regions.
Figure 2 : Loss of household items
Figure 2 shows that the household items commonly lost were utensils, clothes,
furniture, footwear, televisions, and refrigerators. The respondents required more
money to replace these items. In economically backward families, the respondents
lost much of their long-term earnings in the flood. That made the burden of the
flood too severe.

Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024 13
Figure 3 : Loss of food Items
Figure 3 reveals that around 66 per cent of the total respondents lost food stuff.
Even before the flood came, households reserved more food items to celebrate the
biggest festival of Kerala, ‘Onam’. During the flood, most of the families in the study
area stayed on the terrace, and they used these items for cooking. The extra stock of
food grains helped them to avoid starving.

From Table 1, it is clear that no respondents left their Aadhar card and Ration card.
Around 70 per cent of the people moved to a safe place with all essential documents.
Owing to the sudden arrival of a flood, others forgot to take their documents.
To collect financial support from the government, households faced some difficulties
in the post-flood period. The government of Kerala issued valid duplicates to those
who lost their documents within months.
Figure 4 : Number of days taken to clean the house
Figure 4 shows that cleaning the houses of respondents took time. After the flood,
the victims' most significant challenge was removing mud from their houses. Local

government institutions, various organisations, and individuals helped them to clean
the houses. Those buildings were uninhabitable due to the stench of dirt for months.
These issues affected the physical and mental health of the people too.
Figure 5 : Amount spent to clean the house
Figure 5 shows that more than half of the households did not spend money
cleaning their homes and surroundings. Various groups and individuals helped
them. Some of the victims had washed their houses themselves. Forty per cent of
the respondents spent money on this. Among them, most of the households spent
below 2000 rupees.

Figure 6 : Amount spent to clean the well
Figure 6 represents that 66 per cent of the families spent cash to clean wells.
Those were filthy with mud and other wastes. Government institutions and other
groups helped them to clean the well. For quick reuse, most people spent money to
clean wells. Because of financial problems, 28 per cent of them did not clean their
wells which were damaged in the flood.

Table 2 exhibits that one of the households was fully damaged in the flood and had
to rebuild. The government provided financial assistance to the households based
on the damage percentage. More than half of the families got worth of rupees 60,000.
This financial support from the government helped the affected people to make
their houses habitable.

The Figure 7 depicts that comparatively more people were not satisfied with
government support. Insufficient compensation and unfair allocation were the
primary reasons for the dissatisfaction.

The flood affected almost all the households in the study area and had a
considerable impact on the socio-economic life of the people. Table 3 shows that the
average direct cost of the flood is Rs 1,91,835.8 that is seven times higher than the
average income of the households.
4.1 Socio-economic Deprivation of Households
Townsend P. (1987) defined deprivation as “a state of observable and demonstrable
disadvantage relative to the local community or the under society or nation to
which an individual, family or group belongs”. Broadly, it can be classified into two
categories- material and social, indicating a lack of access to the necessities and
social weakness, respectively (Pampalon et al., 2012; Sarkar, 2014). Socio-economic
deprivation means the lack of social and economic advantages that are considered
necessities of a community. The disadvantage of society regarding control access over
material, social or economic resources and opportunities also shows socio-economic
deprivation. It is a multi-dimensional concept (Lamnisos et al., 2019).

Table 4 exhibits that the highest socially and economically deprived families
belong to between Rs. 0-10000 income groups. Most of the respondents in this group
were daily wage earners, and after the flood, they lost working days for nearly two
months. Compared to the high-income group, the burden of the flood was higher in
this category. The standard of living deprivation is the highest in this income group
due to the adverse impact of the flood on their housing, drinking water, electricity
and accumulation of assets.
The flood highly deprived families in the income group of Rs. 10001 to 20000.
Compared to health and standard of living domains, economic deprivation was
higher. More than half of the respondents in this group worked in the unorganised
sectors. Due to the flood, most of them could not go to work, and working places
like shops and small-scale units collapsed. The people lost more than 45 working
days during this time. Moreover, the flood affected other sources of income,
especially the people's occupational equipment, livestock, and rickshaws.
Thirty-six per cent of the total respondents belong to Rs. 21,000 to 30,000 income
group. The economic deprivation was higher because respondents were taken into
debt and used their savings to maintain houses and vehicles and replace furniture
and electronics. Besides that, the income of the respondents decreased after the flood.
The total deprivation of this category is higher than the previous group.
The flood highly deprived the households with an income of Rs. 31,000 to 40,000.
Among this group, health deprivation was comparatively elevated than economic
and standard of living domains. The flood led to psychological damage like emotional
shock, stress, and trauma among the respondents (UN et al., 2018). The impact of
the flood on people’s psychological health was higher than their physical health.
Lavanya Sivan, Anitha V.
20 Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024
There was only one family that had an income range between Rs. 40,001 and 50,000.
The noted thing is that this was the only family in the study with the highest economic
deprivation value. The income source of this family was a shop, which entirely
collapsed in the flood. This household lost its savings, and it took debt to reconstruct
the building. That made the family economically more deprived. The economic impact
adversely affected mental health and standard of living. Therefore the socio-economic
deprivation index showed that this family was highly deprived in the 2018 flood.
Among the income group of Rs. 50,001 to 60,000, health deprivation was relatively
high. From the field survey, it is identified that the people's mental health worsened
than the physical health due to the deluge. They had fear about future flooding, and
some of the respondents decided to migrate to other regions. The government of Kerala
implemented a project, “PARIRAKSHA”, in 2018 to reduce the long-term psychological
impact of the flood (Kiran et al., 2020). This category was also highly deprived in flood.
In the sample, only one family had a monthly income above Rs. 60,000. In this
household, the health deprivation and standard of living deprivation were high and
economic deprivation was moderate. The respondent feared protecting his assets from
the continuous future disasters that made them mentally weak and deprived them of
health status. This is the only household in the study which had moderate economic
deprivation. The socio-economic deprivation of this family was just high and close to
a moderate level. The high-income level reduced the financial burden due to the flood.
The total socio-economic deprivation index of the study area (0.78) showed that
the 2018 flood worsened the health, economic and standard of living status of all the
households. This deprivation will lead the economy back from the path of development.

It is clear from Table 5 that the 2018 flood negatively affected the socio-economic
aspects of all the households in the study area. The condition of no family improved
in health, economic and standard of living after the flood. A few families (12%) were
moderately deprived, especially those above Rs. 30,000 per month. Out of the total
respondents, the standard of living deprivation of 28% families was moderate. Most
of the families in the study were highly deprived in economic terms because the
flood worsened their sources of income and thereby reduced income. A society
characterised by high demand and a low supply of necessities exhibits poor economic
and social status (Pampalon et al., 2000). The overall deprivation showed that most
households were socially and economically deprived in the 2018 disaster.
5. Conclusion and Policy Suggestion
The Kerala flood in 2018 was a big challenge in the development path of the state.
This deluge made a significant change in the health, economic and standard of
living aspects of the people in Alappuzha. Most of the households lost their lifetime
earnings, which pushed down low-income people to be more vulnerable. The study
found that the majority of households in the study area come in the highly deprived
category in the case of the three indices such as health (HDI), economic (EDI) and
standard of living (SDI). No households come in the low level. A comparison of the
three indices shows that EDI is high compared to the other two. The flood affected
their possessions, such as buildings, crops, poultry, livestock, vehicles, shops,
utensils, cloths, electronics. To rebuild and repurchase these items, the households
used their past savings and lent money from both financial and non-financial
institutions. They also lost their working days for over two months. This amplified
the flood’s economic impact on households. The economic burden due to the flood
Lavanya Sivan, Anitha V.
22 Disaster & Development, Vol. 13, Issue 01, January to June 2024
in the high-income category in the study area is relatively lower than the low-income
households. This demands more financial and livelihood support for the lowincome category.
The study reveals that the Kerala flood of 2018 primarily resulted from abnormal
rainfall. However, the impact of floods was accelerated by inefficient dam
management, a lack of proper early warning system, developmental activities, an
outdated disaster management plan, and the exploitation of river basins. The study
area is located in a coastal district with highly flood-prone lowlands. In the context
of this study, we propose the following recommendations for future policy-making:
• Ensure more accurate weather forecasting in the flood-prone areas.
• It is important to update the early warning system to guarantee timely and
precise distribution of information, thereby mitigating the effects of natural
disasters. Kerala’s high literacy rate facilitates the efficient dissemination of
disaster notifications among the people.
• The government should ensure the protection of river basins and efficient reservoir
management for the safety of people should be ensured by the government.
• Regulate the extensive quarrying, mining and deforestation in the Western Ghats.
These activities cause landslides and increase the destructive capacity of floods.
• Timely updating of disaster management strategies is very important in the
unexpected climate-changing scenario.
• It will be better to ensure the displacement of people from flood-prone areas.
• The government should ensure proper long-term counselling sessions due to high
psychological impact of disasters.
• Provide more flood relief to those with low incomes, as their economic
deprivation as high.
The implementation of these recommendations is important for the existence of
flood-prone areas in Kerala.

Kerala Flood of August 2018
1.0 Introduction
Kerala State has an average annual precipitation of about 3000 mm. The rainfall in the State
is controlled by the South-west and North-east monsoons. About 90% of the rainfall occurs
during six monsoon months. The high intensity storms prevailing during the monsoon months
result in heavy discharges in all the rivers. The continuous and heavy precipitation that occurs
in the steep and undulating terrain finds its way into the main rivers through innumerable
streams and water courses. Kerala experienced an abnormally high rainfall from 1 June 2018 to 19 August 2018. This
resulted in severe flooding in 13 out of 14 districts in the State. As per IMD data, Kerala
received 2346.6 mm of rainfall from 1 June 2018 to 19 August 2018 in contrast to an
expected 1649.5 mm of rainfall. This rainfall was about 42% above the normal. Further, the
rainfall over Kerala during June, July and 1st to 19th of August was 15%, 18% and 164%respectively, above normal. Month-wise rainfall for the period, as reported by IMD, are given
in Table-1.

Total 1649.5 2346.6 42
Due to heavy rainfall, the first onset of flooding occurred towards the end of July. A severe
spell of rainfall was experienced at several places on the 8th and 9th of August 2018. The 1- day rainfall of 398 mm, 305 mm, 255 mm, 254 mm, 211 mm and 214 mm were recorded at
Nilambur in Malappuram district, Mananthavadi in Wayanad district, Peermade, Munnar
KSEB and Myladumparain in Idukki district and Pallakad in Pallakad district respectively on
9 August 2018. This led to further flooding at several places in Mananthavadi and Vythiri in
Wayanad district during 8-10, August 2018. Water was released from several dams due to
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 2
heavy rainfall in their catchments. The water levels in several reservoirs were almost near
their Full Reservoir Level (FRL) due to continuous rainfall from 1st of June. Another severe
spell of rainfall started from the 14th of August and continued till the 19th of August, resulting in disastrous flooding in 13 out of 14 districts. The water level records at CWC
G&D sites for some of the rivers in Kerala are given at Annex-I. As per the rainfall records
of IMD, it has been found that the rainfall depths recorded during the 15-17, August 2018
were comparable to the severe storm that occurred in the year 1924.
1.1 Earlier floods in Kerala
The 1924 witnessed unprecedented and very heavy floods in almost all rivers of Kerala.
Heavy losses to life, property and crops etc. had been reported. The rainstorm of 16-18, July
1924 was caused by the South-west monsoon that extended to the south of peninsula on 15th
July and caused rainfall in Malabar. Under its influence, heavy rainfall occurred in almost
entire Kerala. The area under the storm recorded 1-day maximum rainfall on 17th of July, 2- day maximum rainfall for 16-17, July 1924 and 3-day maximum rainfall for 16-18, July
1924. The centre of the 1-day and 2-day rainstorm was located at Devikulam in Kerala which
recorded 484 mm and 751 mm of rainfall respectively. The centre of 3-day rainstorm was
located at Munnar in Kerala which recorded a rainfall of 897 mm in 3 days.
The fury of 1924 flood levels in most of the rivers was still fresh in the memory of people of
Kerala, the year 1961 also witnessed heavy floods and rise in the water levels of reservoirs.
Usually in the State, heavy precipitation is concentrated over a period of 7 to 10 days during
the monsoon when the rivers rise above their established banks and inundate the low lying
areas. But in 1961, floods were unusually heavy not only in duration, but also in the intensity
of precipitation. During the year 1961, the monsoon started getting violent towards the last
week of June and in the early days of August, the precipitation was concentrated on most
parts of the southern region of Kerala. By the first week of July, the intensity gradually
spread over the other parts of the State and the entire State was reeling under severe flood by
the second week of July. The worst affected area was Periyar sub-basin and it also impacted
other sub-basins. Many of the important infrastructures like highways etc were submerged.
After a brief interval, by the middle of July, the monsoon became more violent, affecting the
northern parts of the State. The average rainfall was 56% above normal. The maximum daily
intensities recorded at four districts in 1961 are given in Table-2.

The damage caused by the floods had been severe and varied. It is understood that 115 people
lost their lives due to floods and landslides. Over 50,000 houses were completely and partly
damaged and about 1,15,000 acres of paddy were seriously affected.
2.0 District wise rainfall realised during 1 June 2018 to 22 August 2018

3.0 Analysis of rainfall data
To analyse the August 2018 flooding phenomenon of Kerala, daily rainfall data from 1 June
2018 to 20 August 2018 has been obtained from IMD. The data consist of rainfall records of
67 rain gauge stations spread across the entire State covering both plain and hilly regions. At
some of the stations, rainfall records were missing for a particular date and the same have
been completed using the rainfall records of nearby stations. On scrutiny of data it has been
found that cumulative rainfall realised during 15-17, August 2018 was quite significant, with
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte

more than 800 mm rainfall at Peermade rain gauge station followed by more than 700 mm at
Idukki. The rain gauge stations used for the present study are shown in Fig.1.

3.1 Analysis of rainfall records of 15-17, August 2018
The storm of 15-17, August 2018 was spread over the entire Kerala with eye centred at
Peermade, a place between Periyar and Pamba sub-basins. The storm was so severe that the
gates of 35 dams were opened to release the flood runoff. All 5 overflow gates of the Idukki
Dam were opened, for the first time in 26 years. Heavy rains in Wayanad and Idukki caused
severe landslides and left the hilly districts isolated. On August 15, Kochi International
Airport, India's fourth busiest in terms of international traffic, and the busiest in the State,
suspended all operations until August 26, following flooding of its runway. As per the reports
in media, the flooding has affected hundreds of villages, destroyed several roads and
thousands of homes have been damaged. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority
placed the State on a red alert as a result of the intense flooding. A number of water treatment
plants were forced to cease pumping water, resulting in poor access to clean and potable
water, especially in northern districts of the state. A number of relief camps were opened to
save the people from the vagaries of flood. The situation was regularly monitored by the State
Government, Central Government, and National Crisis Management Committee which also
coordinated the rescue and relief operations.
In order to estimate the rainfall variability at different places and rainfall depths realised in
different river sub-basins, the 1-day, 2-day cumulative, and 3-day cumulative rainfall raster
have been prepared from the point rainfall data. At some places maximum rainfall was
recorded on 15th of August, while at other places the same was recorded on 16th of August.
Hence, 1-day rainfall raster has been prepared for both 15 August 20181 and 16 August 2018
rainfall. The 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day rainfall raster for 15-17, August 2018 rainfall are given
at Annex-II. Using the shape files of the sub-basins, the rainfall depths realised in different
sub-basins and rest of the Kerala is given in Table-4. Table-4: Rainfall depths realised in different sub-basins and rest of the Kerala in stormof 15-17, August 2018

From the above analysis, it can be seen that the 2-day and 3-day rainfall depths of 15-17,
August 2018 rainfall in Pamba, Periyar and Bharathapuzha sub-basins are almost comparable
to the Devikulam storm of 16-18, July 1924. For the entire Kerala the depth of rainfall
realised during 15-17, August 2018 is 414 mm, while the same during 16-18, July 1924 was
443 mm.
3.2 Reservoirs in Kerala
Kerala is having 57 large dams out of which 4 dams are operated by Government of Tamil
Nadu. The total live storage capacity under these dams is 5.806 BCM. This is equal to 7.4%of annual average runoff of all 44 rivers in Kerala, which is about 78 BCM (ref: Water
Resources of Kerala 1974). Out of the above, only 7 reservoirs are having a live storage
capacity of more than 0.20 BCM and they constitute 74% of the total live storage in Kerala.
These reservoirs are given in Table-6.

4.0 Volume of runoff generated during 15-17, August 2018 rainfall
In order to estimate the runoff volume generated in the rainfall event of 15-17, August 2018,
the sub-basins where severe flooding occurred have been analysed and estimated runoff
volume compared with the discharge records of CWC observation sites. For the analysis, the
drainage area of sub-basins, have been estimated up to terminal G&D site of CWC.
Volumetric analyses have been carried out for Periyar, Pamba, Chalakudi, Bharathapuzha and
Kabini sub-basins.
4.1 Runoff computations for Periyar sub-basin
The Periyar, 244 km in length, is the longest river of Kerala. The total drainage area of the
basin is 5389 sq.km out of which nearly 98 % lies in the Kerala State. The State wise
distribution of the drainage area is given in Table-7. Table-7: State wise area distribution of Periyar sub-basin
The river originates at the forest land of Sivagiri peak 80 km South of Devikulam at an
elevation of 2438 m above MSL and traverses the steep mountainous terrain before it is
joined by the Mullayar, 16 km downstream. The river then turns westwards and continues to
flow in that direction for about 16 km on a sandy bed. After a winding course of about 13
km, the river reaches Vandiperiyar and passes through a second narrow gorge below which it
is joined by Perumthura. Further down, it is joined by six tributaries after which the important
tributary Edamala joins Periyar. Passing Malayattur and thereafter taking a meandering
course, the river reaches Alwaye where it divides itself into two branches. The upper branch
joins the Chalakudi river at Punthenvelikara and then expands into a broad sheet of water at
Munambham. The other branch taking a southerly course is broken up into a number of small
channels which fall into the Vembanad lake (as Varapuzha). There are two Hydrological
Observation Stations maintained by CWC on this river i.e at Neeleswaram & Vandiperiyar.
The Periyar river has a drainage area of 4,033 sq km upto CWC gauging station at
Neeleshwaram. The dams with significant storage in Periyar sub-basin are Mulla Periyar,

Idukki and Idamalayar. The catchment area of river at Mulla Periyar dam is about 637 sq.km.
The free catchment between Mulla Periyar and Idukki dam is about 605 sq.km. The
catchment area intercepted by Idamalayar dam is about 472 sq.km. A catchment area map of
Periyar river upto CWC G&D site at Neeleshwaram is given in Fig.2.

From the computation shown in Table-8, the estimated areal rainfall of Periyar sub-basin is
about 190 mm, 454 mm and 584 mm respectively for 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall of 15- 17, August 2018. The runoff volume of 1-day, 2-day and 3-day have been estimated as 675
MCM, 1498 MCM, and 1925 MCM respectively.
The estimated runoff has been compared with the discharge data of Neeleshwaram G&D site
of CWC. The plot of flood hydrograph of Neeleshwaram G&D site is given in Fig.3.

Neeleshwaram G&D records is about 1.93 BCM, while the estimated runoff from IMD
rainfall is about 1.925 BCM for a runoff coefficient of 0.78 for free catchment and 0.85 for
catchments tapped by dams.
Periyar sub-basin consists of about 50% of the total live storage of the State that is about 2.92
BCM. The reservoirs with substantial live storage capacity in Periyar sub-basin are Idukki,
Idamalyar and Mulla Periyar. During the rainfall event of 15-17, August 2018, the total
release during three days from Idukki reservoir was about 345 MCM (spill) and 30 MCM(power house going to Muvattupuzha river) against the inflow volume of 435 MCM. Hence, about 60 MCM of flood runoff was absorbed by Idukki reservoir during 15-17 August.
The average release from Idukki reservoir on 15 August 2018 was about 1100 cumec with
peak release of 1500 cumec against the average inflow of 1640 cumec. Idukki reservoir
received an average 533 cumec discharge from Mulla Periyar on 15 August 2018 with a peak
discharge of 760 cumec. The average release from Idukki reservoir on 16 August 2018 was
about 1400 cumec with peak release of 1500 cumec against the average inflow of about 2000
cumec. Idukki reservoir received an average 650 cumec discharge from Mulla Periyar on 16
August 2018 with a peak discharge of 760 cumec. The average release from Idukki reservoir
on 17 August 2018 was about 1460 cumec with peak release of 1500 cumec against the
average inflow of about 1440 cumec. Idukki reservoir received an average 390 cumec
discharge from Mulla Periyar on 17 August 2018 with a peak discharge of 590 cumec.
4.1.1 Reservoir operation of Idukki
Idukki reservoir lies in the State of Kerala on Periyar river. It has a gross storage of about
1997 MCM at FRL of 732.43 m. It has a gross storage of about 537 MCM at MDDL of
694.94 m. The live storage between FRL and MDDL is about 1460 MCM.
On 10 August 2018 at 00:00 hrs, the level in Idukki dam was 731.82 m i.e. 0.61 m below
FRL. The extra flood cushion available (below FRL) was about 40 MCM only. The inflow
into reservoir at that time was about 649 cumec and spill from dam was about 50 cumec (in
the river) and 115 cumec power house release (going to Muvattupuzha river). As a result, the
water level in the reservoir kept on rising. At 12:00 noon the level touched 732.16 m. To
contain the level within FRL, the spill from the reservoir was increased to 750 cumec (plus
118 cumec power house release) by 17:00 hrs on 10 August 2018 against similar inflows.
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 11
After that, inflows into reservoir dropped a bit and were in the range of 500 – 700 cumec. The
reservoir releases were maintained at higher levels (spill 750 cumec + 115 cumec power
house release) until 18:00 hrs on 13 August 2018 in order to make space in the live storage
zone to accommodate possible higher floods that might come. As a consequence, the
reservoir level dropped to 730.80 m increasing the extra flood cushion below FRL to about
90 MCM.
The inflows into the dam started rising from 18:00 hrs on 14 August 2018 when the level in
the reservoir was 730.88 m (i.e. an extra flood cushion of about 85 MCM. The outflows from
the dam were increased to about 1615 cumec (1500 cumec spill + 115 cumec power house
release) by 18:00 hrs on 15 August 2018 and continued until 03:00 hrs on 16 August 2018.
The peak inflow of about 2532 cumec into dam occurred at 22:00 hrs on 15 August 2018
when the corresponding release from the dam was of the order of 1614 cumec (1500 cumec
spill + 114 cumec power house release). Thus, the peak was attenuated from 2532 cumec to
1500 cumec (an attenuation of about 41% downstream of Idukki). The reservoir touched FRL
of 732.43 m at 01:00 hrs on 17 August 2018. The inflow, outflow and water level at Idukki
reservoir are given in Fig.4.

It may be noted that a flood peak of about 8800 cumec was observed at Neeleswaram G&D
site. That means apart from a release of about 1500 cumec from Idukki reservoir, the flood
peak generated in the downstream free catchment was of the order of about 7300 cumec. Even if there was no or very little release from Idukki reservoir (a hypothetical situation in
the wake of floods of such a magnitude), the downstream areas would still have received a
peak of about 7500-8000 cumec. Therefore, it can be concluded that Idukki reservoir’s
contribution to the overall flooding situation downstream was a miniscule. It had, in fact, provided an attenuation of flood peak by about 1,030cumec when peak inflow impinged the
reservoir. 4.1.2 Reservoir operation of Idamalayar
The Idamalayar Dam is located on the Idamalayar river, a tributary of the Periyar river in
Kerala. Its live storage is about 1018 MCM. The water level in Idamalayar reservoir on 8
August 2018 was 168.06 m i.e. just 1 m below FRL. The reservoir was nearly 97% full in
terms of live storage. The dedicated flood space between FRL (169 m) and MWL (170.3 m)
is about 60 MCM only. There were no spills till 8 August 2018. The inflow, outflow and
water level at Idamalayar reservoir (showing no attenuation after 9 August 2018) are given in
Fig.5.

As per dam site rainfall records, during 8-17 August, 2018 there was a rainfall of about 1,100
mm in its catchment with maximum 1-day rainfall of 230 mm occurring on 16 August 2018.
The inflow into the dam started rising from 8 August 2018 and attained its peak of 1164
cumec on 16 August 2018. The average spill from the reservoir was 1271 cumec. It can be
seen that in case of Idamalayar reservoir, there was no attenuation of peak owing to two
reasons: heavy rainfall; and reservoir being too close to FRL prior to the onset of flood event.
4.2 Runoff computations for Pamba sub-basin
The Pamba, 176 km in length is the third longest river in Kerala. It is formed by the
confluence of the Pamba Aar, Kaki Aar, Arudhai Aar, Kakkad Aar and Kall Aar. The Pamba
Aar rises in the Peermedu Plateau at an elevation of 1670 m. A drainage area map of
river Pamba and Manimala is shown in Fig.6.
Fig.6: Drainage area map of Pamba and Manilmala rivers
The Kaki Aar, which forms the major tributary of the Pamba river, is a much larger stream at
the beginning than the main river. The Pamba river, after receiving the Kaki Aar flows in a
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 14
Westerly direction till it is joined by the Arudhai Aar. At Narayanamuzhi, it turns and
follows a south-easterly direction until the Kakkad Aar joins it. Beyond the confluence, the
river flows in a Southerly direction up to Vadasserikkara where it is joined by the Kallar
which has its origin in the Valanjakkatti Malai.
There are two Hydrological Observation stations maintained by CWC on this river/Tributary
i.e at Kalloppara on river Manimala & Malakkara on river Pamba. The major reservoir
project in Pamba basin is Kakki dam. At Pandanad the river bifurcates, one branch taking a
westerly course. The Manimala joins the Pamba in its Neeretupuram branch. The river, thereafter, flows northwards and falls into the Vembanad lake through several branches, the
important ones being the Pallathuruthy Aar and the Nedumudy Aar. The Pamba basin
experiences good rainfall, moderate temperature and humid atmosphere. The South West and
North East monsoon have great influence over the climatic condition of the basin. Even
though the coastal regions of the basin experience hot with high humidity, the hilly region is

From the computation shown in Table-9, the estimated areal rainfall of Pamba sub-basin is
about 179 mm, 397 mm and 537 mm respectively for 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall of 15- 17, August 2018. For Manimala river up to CWC G&D site, the runoff volume of 1-day, 2- day and 3-day have been estimated as 92 MCM, 204 MCM, and 276 MCM respectively
assuming a runoff coefficient of 0.75 corresponding to three day observed runoff of 277
MCM at Kallooppara G&D site. The same runoff coefficient has also been adopted for
Pamba sub-basin with estimated 1-day, 2-day and 3-day runoff of 223 MCM, 497 MCM and
668 MCM upto Malakkara G&D site. From the flood hydrograph of Malakkara G&D site
total runoff in 3 days is about 533 MCM. The difference in volume may be attributed to
retention of overtopped water over river banks in nearby areas.

In Pamba sub-basin there are 8 dams and one barrage. The total live storage capacity is 487
MCM, which is 10.5% of the average annual runoff of 4.64 BCM (4640 MCM). Out of the
total live storage capacity only Kakki with the 447 MCM live storage has a significant
storage. The Kakki storage is about 92% of the total live storage in Pamba sub-basin. Next to
Kakki storage is the Pamba storage (live storage only 31 MCM). The total live storage of all
other reservoirs and barrages is only 9 MCM.
4.2.1 Reservoir operation of Kakki
Kakki reservoir is built across the river Kakki, a tributary of Pamba river in Kerala. It has a
gross storage of about 450 MCM at FRL of 981.46 m and storage of 7.6 MCM at MDDL of
908.3 m. The live storage of Kakki reservoir is about 442 MCM. On 8 July 2018 the reservoir
level was 965.05 m i.e. 16.41 m below FRL. In terms of storage volume, the live storage was
226 MCM i.e. 51% of total live storage capacity. Subsequently, there was continuous rain
during 9-27, July. As the reservoir was only half-full prior to this spell of rains, there were no
spills and reservoir level rose to 979.04 m on 28 July 2018 with a live storage of about 403
MCM. The reservoir was now 91% full. So, the Kakki reservoir absorbed this heavy spell of
rain fully. However, as a result, it got very close to FRL in July itself with only 39 MCMextra flood cushion available below FRL. The releases from Kakki reservoir could not be
made to deplete water level in Kakki reservoir, as at that time the below MSL areas in
Kuttanad region were already experiencing heavy inundation and any release would have
added to the misery of people living in that region. Moreover, there is a Thottapalli spillway
at Vembanad lake that receives waters from Pamba, Achenkovil, Meenachil, and Manimala
rivers, out of which only Pamba basin is having a control structure namely Kakki dam. The
other three are uncontrolled rivers. The Thottapalli barrage spillway has a discharging
capacity of around 630 cumec. Therefore, the waters take time to pass through the barrage
and get accumulated in the low-lying areas around Vembanad lake. So, the discharge from
Kakki reservoir, when the low lying areas in Kuttanad region are already experiencing
inundation, makes it a tricky situation i.e. in deciding whether to hold water in Kakki dam to
save Kuttanad from further flooding or to release water anticipating possible future flood
events.
If Kuttanad region was not flooded prior to the second spell of extreme rains, ideally, when
this spell of rain once subsided, the reservoir level could have been brought down to some
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 17
extent to moderate any future extreme flood events that might impinge the reservoir in the
monsoon month of August. Unfortunately, this happened 11 days later.
On 9 August 2018, the reservoir level was 981.25 m and it was nearly with and no spills from
the dam. Now, any flood event could have been moderated between the space available
between FRL (981.46 m) and MWL (982.16 m). Only about 20 MCM dedicated flood space
is available between FRL and MWL. As per dam site rainfall record, the rainfall during the
second event that occurred during 9-20 August 2018 was 1724 mm with 590 mm rainfall in
just two days i.e. 15-16, August 2018. The maximum inflow in the reservoir was 835 cumec
with a corresponding release of 938 cumec. As there was no space left in the reservoir, it
could not provide any flood attenuation during this second event and the space between FRL
and MWL was quickly exhausted. The inflow, outflow, water level attained at Kakki
reservoir are given in Fig.9.
Fig.9: Inflow, Outflow and Water Level attained at Kakki reservoir
It may also be noted that this was an extreme flood event. The total flood peak observed in
Pamba sub-basin was of the order 2900 cumec. Even if there was just 500 cumec release
from Kakki, the downstream flood peak would still have been about 2400 cumec.

4.2.2 Combined runoff of Pamba, Manimala, Meenachil and Achenkovil rivers
Four major west flowing rivers namely Achenkovil, Pamba, Manimala and Meenachil drain
directly into the southern part of Vembanad Lake while a southern branch of Periyar (further
north of Muvattupuzha) drains into Cochin Kayal and finally into the Arabian sea through
Kochi outlet. The Vembanad Lake is bordered by Alappuzha (Alleppey), Kottayam and
Ernakulam districts of Kerala covering an area of about 200 sq km and extending 80 km in a
NW-SE direction from Munambam in the north to Alleppey in the south. The width of the
lake varies from 500 m to 4 km and the depth from 1m to 12m. An index map of Vembanad
lake is given in Fig.10.

Manimala, Meenachil, Pamba and Achenkovil flow into the lake south of Thanneermukkom.
While Muvattupuzha river flows into the Cochin backwaters north of Thanneermukkom
barrage. Kuttanadu is a marshy delta in the southern part of the lake, formed by four river
network namely, Pamba, Manimala, Achankoil and Meenachi together with the backwaters in
and around the Vembanad lake. Large parts of the vast estuary lie below the sea level up to a
depth of about 2.5 m, waterlogged for most part of the year subject to flood and inundation
during the monsoons and saline water intrusion during the summer months. The Vembanad
lake was declared as a Ramsar Site in November 2002. A catchment area map of Pamba,
Manimala, Achankoil and Meenachi river systems up to Vembanad lake is given in Fig.11.

As per July 2008 report of Planning Commission, the water carrying capacity of the system is
reported to have reduced to an abysmal 0.6 BCM from 2.4 BCM as a result of land
reclamation. The Pamba reservoir (31 MCM) and Kakki reservoir (447 MCM), in the Pamba
sub basin can hardly regulate 10.5% of the average annual flow in the Pamba River. All other
storages in Pamba river are very small ones having no appreciable storage capacity. The other
three rivers Manimala, Meenachil and Achenkovil have no storages on them. The
Thottappally spillway Constructed in 1954, as part of Kuttanadu development scheme for
relieving flood condition in Kuttanadu, by diverting flood waters of Pamba, Manimala, Achenkovil and Meenachil directly to the sea. The Thottappally spillway consists of a leading
channel 1310 m long 365 m wide with a bridge cum regulator across the spillway channel.
The bridge cum regulator is 365 m along with 40 vents, each having 7.6 m clear span.
Though the original discharge capacity of the spillway was about 1812 cumec, it is reported
that at present the average maximum discharge passing through the spillway is limited to 630
cumec, which is almost 1/3rd of the design capacity of the spillway.
The runoff generated from Pamba, Manimala, Achenkovil and Meenachil rivers during 15-17
August rainfall was about 1.63 BCM (1630 MCM) against the 0.6 BCM (600 MCM) carrying
capacity of Vembanad lake. Further, the discharging capacity of 630 cumec of Thottappally
spillway was other major constraint for the disposal of runoff. Considering the lake carrying
capacity of about 600 MCM and discharging capacity of 630 cumec of Thottappally spillway
and about 1706 cumec present discharging capacity of Thaneermukkom barrage, it can be
concluded that out of 1.63 BCM the runoff generated during the 15 to 17 August 2018
rainfall, only about 0.605 BCM runoff was possible to drain out of the Vembanad lake. The
remaining runoff volume of about 1 BCM created the rise of the water level in the lake and
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte

nearby areas. This continuous rising of lake water may be one of the reason of overall change
in the river hydrodynamics of Pamba, Manimala, Meenachil and Achenkovil river systems
resulting higher water level for a particular discharge in these rivers. Considering the high
rainfall during 15-17, August 2018, the absence of appreciable storage reservoirs in the
upstream on the above rivers, shrinkage of carrying capacity of Vembanad Lake and
reduction of the capacity of Thottappally spillway may have worsened the flooding in the
Kuttanad region and the backwater flows to the low-lying areas in the upper reaches of the
lake. This may be the reason of the heavy flooding experienced in the low-lying areas closer
to the Vembanad lake in the Pathnamthitta, Kottayam and Alapuzha districts.
4.3 Runoff computations for Chalakudy sub-basin
Chalakudy River is the fifth longest river in Kerala. The Chalakudy river is formed by the
confluence of five streams, Parambikulam, Kuriarkutty, Sholayar, Karappara and
Anakkayam, all of them originating in the Anamalai Hills of the Western Ghats. Out of these,
Parambikulam and Sholayar rivers originate from the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu. Karappara and Kuriarkutty rivers originate from the Palakkad district in Kerala. At about
470m above M.S.L. the Parambikulam joins the Kuriarkutty river. Further 9 km down, the
river is joined by the Sholayar. The Karappara joins the main river at about 455m above
M.S.L. The Anakkayam joins the main river 8 km further down at 365m above M.S.L. In the
initial course, the river passes through thick forests and its flow is broken by many falls till it
reaches the plains at Athirapally.
The Chalakudi river basin is bounded by the Karuvannur sub-basin on the north and the
Periyar sub-basin on the south. The basin consists of about 30,000 ha of wet lands. The basin
receives and average rainfall of about 3000 mm. The total drainage area of the river is 1704
sq.km and out of this 1404 sq.km lies in Kerala and the rest 300 sq.km in Tamil Nadu. The
length of the river is about 130 km.
The famous waterfalls, Athirappilly falls and Vazhachal falls, are situated on this river. The
hydro electric projects on Chalakudy River are Sholayar and Peringalkutthu Hydro Electric
Projects. For irrigation purposes Thumboormoozhy weir is constructed across this river. It
merges with the Periyar River near Elenthikara, adjacent to Manjali North
Paravur in Ernakulam district and finally joins Kodungallur backwaters and Arabian Sea at
Azhekode. The Parambikulam Dam has been built on the Parambikulam river, one of its four
tributaries. The river finally empties into the right arm of the Periyarat Elanthikkara in
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 22
Puthenvelikara village of Ernakulam district. The river derives its name from Chalakudy
town which is an important town in the basin. The river flows through Palakkad, Thrissur and
Ernakulamdistricts of Kerala. A drainage area map of Chalakudy river up to CWC G&D site
at Arangali is shown in Fig.12.

From the computation shown in Table-11, the estimated areal rainfall of Chalakudy sub-basin
is about 140 mm, 324 mm and 421 mm respectively for 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall of 15- 17, August 2018. The runoff volume of 1-day, 2-day and 3-day has been estimated as 169
MCM, 391 MCM, and 508 MCM respectively.
The estimated runoff has been compared with the discharge data of Arangaly G&D site of
CWC. The plot of flood hydrograph of Arangaly G&D site is given in Fig.13.
Fig.13: Discharge data of Chalakudy river at Arangaly G&D site
The maximum discharge at Arangaly G&D site was about 2900 cumec on 16.08.2018 at
08:00 hours. The cumulative runoff for 15-17, August 2018, computed from the Arangaly
G&D records is about 525 MCM, while the estimated runoff from IMD rainfall is about 508
MCM for a runoff coefficient of 0.9. The Chalakudy sub-basin has a total of 6 reservoirs, out of these 1 reservoir is located in
Tamil Nadu and rest 5 reservoirs are in Kerala. Chalakudy is the steepest river of Kerala. The
total drainage area of the river is 1704 sq.km, out of this 1404 lies in Kerala and the rest 300
sq.km lies in Tamil Nadu. The average annual runoff is about 3121 MCM. All the 6
reservoirs in the system have a combined Live Storage of 719 MCM, which enables the
reservoirs to store 23% of the average annual runoff. The biggest reservoir in this system is
the Parambikulam with a Live Storage of 381 MCM. In these six reservoirs, three reservoirs
situated in Kerala along with TN-Sholayar reservoir, are being operated by the Govt of Tamil
Nadu under the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project system. The remaining two, Kerala-Sholayar
and Poringalkuth reservoir are being operated by KSEB Limited. The Thumboormoozhy weir

From the inflow and release data, it can be seen that release from Kerala Sholayar reservoir
was almost same as that of inflow during 15-17, August 2018, while release from
Parambikulam system was about 8 MCM more than the inflow of 16 August 2018. The 8
MCM more release from Parambikulam system on 16 August 2018 would have slightly
affected the flow in river when compared with 222 MCM overall runoff generated in the sub- basin on the same date.
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte

Poringalkuthu reservoir is having free catchment area of about 529 sq.km. Its live storage
capacity is about 30 MCM. Its FRL is at EL 424 m and crest level of spillway is at EL 419.4
m. The discharging capacity of the spillway is 2265 cumec. Apart from its free catchment this
reservoir also receives the spills from Parambikulam, Kerala Sholayar and Tunakadavu dams. As per rainfall data of 16 August 2018 of Kerala Sholayar dam site and power house site,
Idamalayar dam site, about 293 mm rainfall occurred in the free catchment area of
Poringalkuthu. The total inflow estimated into this reservoir on 16 August 2018 is about 258
MCM against the discharging capacity of spillway of 196 MCM, resulting overtopping of the
dam.
4.4 Runoff computations for Bharathapuzha sub-basin
Bharathapuzha is the second longest west flowing river that drains into the Arabian Sea in
Kerala. This sub-basin is bounded in the east by the Cauvery basin, in the west by the
Arabian Sea. The catchment area of Bharatpuzha at Kumbidi G&D site of CWC is about
5787 sq.km. The drainage area map of Bharatpuzha at Kumbidi G&D site is given in Fig.14.

Its total drainage area is about 6186 sq.km out of which 71% lies in Kerala and rest 21% in
Tamil Nadu. The basin is elongated in shape. There are five Hydrological Observation
Stations on this river maintained by CWC at Kumbidi, Pulamanthole, Mankara, Pudur &
Ambarampalayam. The Bharathapuzha or Ponnani river as it is called in the lower reaches,
rises in the Eastern slopes of Anamalai hills of the Western Ghats at an elevation of 2,250m
above MSL and flows in the North-Westerly direction in Pollachi taluk of Coimbatore district
in Tamil Nadu.
At about 45 km downstream of its origin, it is joined by a tributary namely the Palar on its
right bank. Traversing another 15 km westwards, it enters the Palakkad district of Kerala
through Palakkad gap. At about 100 km downstream of its origin, it is jointed by the
Kalpathipuzha on the right bank. Traversing another 109 km in the Westward direction
through Palakkad and Malapuram districts, it finally discharges into the Arabian Sea near
Ponnani town. The total length of the river is about 209 km. The upper reaches of the river is
called as the Aliyar. When it enters Kerala, it is called as Kannadipuzha till it meets the
Kalpathipuzha. After confluence with the Kalpathipuzha, it is known as Bharathapuzha or
Ponnani River. It is joined by Gayathripuzha on the left bank and Pulanthode on the right
bank as it flows down to the Arabian Sea. It also receives a large number of small streams
and rivulets. The Gayathripuzha, Kalpathipuzha and Pulanthode, are the three major
tributaries. All the three tributaries rise in the Western slopes of the different ranges of the
Western Ghats and drains a major parts of the Palghat, Trichur and Malapuram districts.
During rainfall event of 15-17, August 2018 the rainfall depths realised in Free
Bharathapuzha and Malampuzhadam catchments along with estimated runoff are given in

From the computation shown in Table-14, the estimated areal rainfall of Bharathapuzhasub- basin is about 106 mm, 287 mm and 361 mm respectively for 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall
of 15-17, August 2018. The runoff volume of 1-day, 2-day and 3-day has been estimated as
442 MCM, 1197 MCM and 1507 MCM respectively.
The estimated runoff has been compared with the discharge data of Kumbidi G&D site of
CWC. The plot of flood hydrograph of Kumbidi G&D site is given in Fig.15.
Fig.15: Discharge data of Bharathapuzha River at Kumbidi G&D site
The maximum discharge at Kumbidi G&D site was about 6400 cumec on 17.08.2018 at
08:00 hours. The cumulative runoff for 15-17, August 2018, computed from the Kumbidi
G&D records is about 1.51 BCM, while the estimated runoff from IMD rainfall is about
1.507 BCM for a runoff coefficient of 0.72 for free catchment and 0.80 for catchments tapped
by dam.
The major reservoir in Bharatpuzha sub-basin is Malampuzha. The inflow and outflow graph
of Malapuzha reservoir is presented in Fig.16. From the plot it can be seen that during 8-9,
August 2018 the total inflow into the reservoir was about 97 MCM against the release of 48
MCM. During 8-9, August 2018, the reservoir absorbed about 49 MCM of flood water and
thus resulting less flooding in downstream area. During 15-17, August 2018 the total inflow

into the reservoir was about 53 MCM against the release of 66 MCM, hence the released
volume was about 13 MCM more than the inflow, which is insignificant in comparison to
estimated runoff of 1510 MCM from the basin.

4.5 Runoff computations for Kabini sub-basin
River Kabani is one of the major tributaries of Cauvery river in southern India. It originates
in the Western Ghats of Wayanad district of Kerala by the confluence of Panamaram and
Mananthavady rivers. It flows eastwards to join the Cauveryriver at Tirumakudalu,
in Karnataka. The Banasura Sagar Dam is a stone masonry constructed on Karamanathodu
tributary of the Kabini river. A canal from Banasura Sagar reservoir supplies the water to
Kakkayam hydro electric power project and meets the demand for irrigation and drinking
water in the region. Karapuzha dam is constructed on Karapuzha river, another tributary of
the Kabini river. The total drainage area of the Kabini sub-basin upto CWC G&D site at
Muthankera is 1546 sq.km. The total drainage area of the Kabini river in Kerala is about 1920
sq.km. The drainage area map is given in Fig.17.

From the computation shown in Table-6, the estimated areal rainfall of Kabini sub-basin is
about 104 mm, 279 mm and 311 mm respectively for 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall of 08-10,
August 2018. The runoff volume of 1-day, 2-day and 3-day has been estimated as 123 MCM,
329 MCM and 367 MCM respectively.
The estimated runoff has been compared with the discharge data of Muthankara G&D site of
CWC. The plot of flood hydrograph of Muthankara G&D site is given in Fig.18.
Fig.18: Discharge data of Kabini River at Muthankara G&D site
The maximum discharge at Muthankara G&D site was about 2235 cumec on 10 August 2018
at 12:00 hours. The cumulative runoff for 8-10, August 2018, computed from the Muthankara
G&D records is about 367 MCM, while the estimated runoff from IMD rainfall is also about
367 MCM for a runoff coefficient of 0.70 for free catchment and 0.75 for catchments tapped
by dams.
Bansaura Sagar reservoir with gross storage of 209.25 MCM was on its FRL at EL 775.60 m
since 16 July 2018. Since then, whatever inflow came into the reservoir, the same was
released. On 8th and 9th of August 2018 rainfall records of dam site show a rainfall of 278
and 443 mm respectively with consequent inflow 11.32 MCM and 19.67 MCM respectively.
Since reservoir level was at FRL, entire inflow was released from spillway. The inflow,
outflow and recorded rainfall at dam site is given in Table-16.

5.0 Rainfall depths realised for entire Kerala during 15-17, August 2018 and
estimated runoff
Using 1-day, 2-day and 3-day rainfall raster, estimated rainfall and runoff for entire Kerala
are presented in presented in Table-17. Considering the saturated ground condition and
estimated runoff coefficient in different sub-basins, a runoff coefficient of 0.75 has been
adopted for the entire Kerala.

From the estimated quantity of runoff, it can be said that this huge runoff generated within a
short period of 3 days was beyond the carrying capacity of most of the rivers in Kerala,
resulting overbank flows from most of the rivers. Further, total catchment area tapped by
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 32
dams in Kerala excluding barrages is about 6610 sq.km. Taking a runoff coefficient of 0.8, the runoff generated from the catchment tapped by the dams during the 3 days rainfall of 15- 17, August 2018 has been estimated about 2.19 BCM, out of total runoff of 12 BCM for
entire Kerala. The total live storage of Kerala is about 5.8 BCM. Even with 20% of the live
storage availability of 14 August 2018, the available flood moderation extent would have
been only 1.16 BCM against the estimated inflow of 2.19 BCM. It shows that in any case, it
was essential to make releases from reservoirs.
6.0 Findings of CWC Study
From analysis of rainfall data of IMD, discharge data of CWC G&D sites and inflow/outflow
data of reservoir received from Government of Kerala, the findings are as under:
i. Kerala terrain is a linear one with elevation varying from about -2 m to 1500 m in a
stretch of about 80 to 100 km across the State. The Western Ghats terrain has steep
slopes, while the rest of terrain is rolling/plains. The time of concentration (the time
required to travel the water from farthest point of project catchment to the project
catchment outlet) of most of the reservoirs in the region is about 2 to 3 hours only.
ii. During the August 2018 flood 13 out of 14 districts of the State were severely
affected from flood due to heavy rainfall. As per IMD, Kerala received about 2346.6
mm of rainfall during 1 June 2018 to 19 August 2018 against the normal rainfall of
1649.5 mm, which was 42% above the normal. During 1 August 2018 to 19 August
2018 total rainfall occurred in Kerala was about 758.6 mm against the normal of
287.6 mm, which was 164% above normal.
iii. A one day rainfall of 398 mm, 305 mm, 255 mm, 254 mm, 211 mm and 214mm
respectively was recorded at Nilambur in Mallapuram district, Mananthavady in
Wayanad district, Peermade, Munnar and Myladumpara in Idukki district and at
Pallakad district respectively on 9 August 2018. The severe rainfall in Wayanad
district resulted in heavy flooding at Mananthavadi and Vythiri during 8-10, August
2018.
iv. As per analysis carried out by CWC, the rainfall of 15-17, August 2018 having eye of
storm near Peermade between Pamba and Periyar sub-basins, was almost of the same
order as that of rainfall of Devikulam, Kerala which occurred during 16-18, July
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 33
1924. As per the historical records severe most flooding had occurred in Kerala
during the year 1924. The average cumulative rainfall of 15-17, August 2018 is about
414 mm for entire Kerala. The consequent cumulative runoff of three days for the
entire Kerala (area about 38,800 sq.km) is about 12 BCM (12,000 MCM) for a runoff
coefficient of 0.75.
v. Further, total catchment area tapped by dams in Kerala excluding barrages is about
6610 sq.km. Taking a runoff coefficient of 0.8 the runoff generated from the
catchment tapped by the dams during the 3 days rainfall of 15-17, August 2018 has
been estimated about 2.19 BCM, out of total runoff of 12 BCM for entire Kerala. The
total live storage of Kerala is about 5.8 BCM. Even with 20% of the live storage
availability on 14 August 2018, the available flood moderation extent would have
been only 1.16 BCM against the estimated inflow of 2.19 BCM. It shows that in any
case, it was essential to make releases from reservoirs.
vi. Out of 758.6 mm rainfall from 1 August 2018 to 19 August 2018, about 414 mm
rainfall occurred in just three days viz 15-17, August 2018, which created severe
flooding in the State. Due to severe rainfall from 15-17, August 2018, the gates of
about 35 dams were also opened due to extremely large inflow of water in the
reservoirs. During August 2018, the reservoirs were either at FRL or only few feet
below the FRL. vii. During 15-17, August 2018, the 3-day rainfall depths realised in Periyar, Pamba,
Chalakudi and Bharathapuzha sub-basins were 588 mm, 538 mm, 421 mm and 373
mm respectively and these depths are of the same order as that of 1924 rainfall.
viii. As per CWC’s Neeleswaram G&D site (Periyar sub-basin) records, the maximum
discharge passed in Periyar river was 8800 cumec on 16 August 2018 at 15:00 hrs and
maximum water level attained was at EL 12.4 m. The earlier HFL was recorded on 27
July 1974 at EL 11.105 m. The major storages in Periyar basin are Idukki (live
storage 1.4 BCM) and Idamalayar (LS 1.1 BCM). The peak release on 16 August
2018 from Idukki was 1500 cumec against a peak inflow of 2532 cumec achieving a
flood moderation of 1032 cumec. The release from Idamalayar on 16 August 2018
was 963 cumec against an inflow of 1164 cumec. The discharge in Periyar river at
Neeleswaram G&D site on 17 August 2018 was recorded as 8600 cumec and release
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 34
from Idukki and Idamalayar were 1500 cumec (inflow 1610 cumec) and 1272 cumec
(inflow 1007 cumec). On analysis of data it has been found that the releases from
these dams were the controlled releases, as the discharging capacity of these dams are
5013 cumec (Idukki) and 3012 cumec (Idamalyar).
ix. The maximum discharge in Pamba river at CWC, G&D site (Malakkara) was 2900
cumec on 16 August 2018 with corresponding water level at EL 9.58 m. The earlier
recorded HFL was 8.2 m. The major reservoir in Pamba sub-basin is Kakki and
release from this reservoir was 488 cumec (15th of August), 899 cumec (16th of
August), 443 cumec (17th of August), 356 cumec (18th of August), 309 cumec (19th
of August) against the spillway capacity of 1788 cumec. The reservoir was at EL
980.91 m on 14 August 2018, against the FRL at EL 981.46 m. The maximum
reservoir level attained on 19 August 2018 was 981.4 m. x. From the analysis it has been found that the dams in Kerala neither added to the flood
nor helped in reduction of flood, as most of the dams were already at FRL or very
close to FRL on 14 August 2018, due to more than normal rainfall in the months of
June to July 2018. It may be noted that, had the reservoir been a few feet below FRL,
the flooding conditions would have not changed much, as the severe storm continued
for 3 days and even for 4 days at majority of the places, and in any case it would have
been necessary to release from the reservoirs after 1st day of the extreme rainfall.
xi. Nevertheless, it is essential to review the rule curves of all the reservoirs in Kerala. The rule curves need to be meticulously drawn particularly for the reservoirs having
the live storage capacity, of more than 200 MCM in order to create some dynamic
flood cushion for moderating the floods of lower return periods particularly in the
early period of monsoon. xii. The runoff generated from Pamba, Manimala Achenkovil and Meenachil rivers
during 15-17, August 2018 rainfall was about 1.63 BCM against the 0.6 BCMcarrying capacity of Vembanad lake. Further, the discharging capacity of 630 cumec
of Thottappally spillway was the other major constraint for the disposal of runoff.
Considering the lake carrying capacity of about 600 MCM and discharging capacity
of 630 cumec of Thottappally spillway and about 1706 cumec present discharging
capacity of Thaneermukkom barrage, it can be concluded that out of 1.63 BCM the
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 35
runoff generated during the 15-17, August 2018 rainfall, only about 0.605 BCMrunoff was possible to drain out of the Vembanad lake. The remaining runoff volume
of about 1 BCM created the rise of the water level in the lake and nearby areas. This
continuous rising of lake water may be one of the reason of overall change in the river
hydrodynamics of Pamba, Manimala, Meenachil and Achenkovil river systems
resulting higher water level for a particular discharge in these rivers. Considering the
high rainfall during 15-17, August 2018, the absence of appreciable storage reservoirs
in the upstream in the above rivers along with the shrinkage of carrying capacity of
Vembanad Lake and reduction of the capacity of Thottappally spillway worsened the
flooding in the Kuttanad region and the backwaters flows to the low lying areas in the
upper reaches of the lake.
xiii. The worst affected districts noticed were Wayanad (Kabini sub-basin), Idukki
(Periyar sub-basin), Ernakulam (Periyar and Chalakudi) sub-basins, Alleppey and
Pathanamthitta (both in Pamba sub-basin).
xiv. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that August 2018 flood in Kerala was due to severe
storm occurrences during 8-9, August 2018 and 15-17, August 2018. The storm of 15- 17, August 2018 resulted in heavy flooding in Periyar, Pamba, Chalakudi and
Bharatpuzha sub-basins of Kerala. The rainfall during 15-17, August 2018 was almost
comparable to the historical 16-18, July 1924 rainfall of Kerala, particularly in
Periyar, Pamba, Chalakudi and Bharatpuzha sub-basins.
xv. The release from reservoirs had only minor role in flood augmentation as released
volume from the reservoirs were almost similar to inflow volumes. In fact Idukki
reservoir absorbed a flood volume of about 60 MCM during 15-17, August 2018.
Even, with the 75 percent-filled reservoir conditions, the current flood could have not
been mitigated as 1-day rainfall in majority of the area was more than 200 mm and
severe rainfall continued for 3 to 4 days.
7.0 Recommendations
i. It is essential to review the rule curves of all the reservoirs in Kerala. The rule curves
need to be formulated for both conservation as well operations during the flood,
Central Water Commission Hydrology (S) Dte
Kerala Floods August 2018 Page 36
particularly for the reservoirs having the live storage capacity of more than 200
MCM in order to create some dynamic flood cushion for moderating the floods of
lower return periods particularly in the early period of monsoon.
ii. For efficient discharge of flood runoff from Vembanad lake, the approach channels
to Thottappally spillway and the passage of the Thaneermukkom barrage should be
widened taking into consideration the lake hydrology, ecology, saline water
intrusion, etc based on scientific and engineering inputs.
iii.In basins like Periyar, Pamba and Achenkovil basins, Kerala should explore the
possibilities of creating suitable storage reservoirs, wherever feasible, for flood
moderation and other multipurpose uses.
iv. The Poringalkuthu dam should be inspected by DSRP panel and design flood, spillway capacity of Poringalkuthu dam must be reviewed.
8.0 Limitations
i. The rainfall analysis carried out in the present study is based on the rainfall records of
67 rain gauge stations of IMD spread across the entire State covering both plain and
hilly regions. In hilly terrains of Chalakudy, Periyar, Pamba, Kabini and other sub- basins, rainfall records of some more rain gauge stations may provide a further finer
estimate of rainfall and also the inflow volume into the reservoirs.
ii. The gauge records at some of the CWC G&D sites could not be observed on 16th and
17th of August 2018 because of inaccessibility of site due to severe flooding. Hence,
the estimated discharge may differ from the one that actually occurred.
iii. Some of the observations regarding the discharging capacity of Thottappally and
Thanneermukkom barrages, carrying capacity of Vembanad lake etc are based on the
reports of the other institutions.

Disaster of Kerala
Date	July 2018 – August 2018
Location	Kerala, India
Cause	Heavy rain
Discharges
Landslide
Deaths	483
Property damage	₹40,000 crore (US$4.7 billion) (estimated)[1]
On 16 August 2018, severe floods affected the south Indian state Kerala, due to unusually heavy rainfall during the monsoon season.[2][3][4] It was the worst flood in Kerala in nearly a century.[5] Over 483 people died,[6] and about one million[7][8] people were evacuated, mainly from Chengannur,[9] Pandanad,[10] Edanad, Aranmula, Kozhencherry, Ayiroor, Ranni, Pandalam, Kuttanad, Malappuram, Aluva, Chalakudy, Thrissur, Thiruvalla, Eraviperoor, Vallamkulam, North Paravur, Chendamangalam, Chellanam, Vypin Island, and Palakkad. All 14 districts of the state were placed on red alert.[3][11] According to the Kerala government, one-sixth of the total population of Kerala was directly affected by the floods and related incidents.[12] The Indian government declared it a Level 3 Calamity, or "calamity of a severe nature".[13][14] It is the worst flood in Kerala after the great flood of '99 that took place in 1924.

Thirty-five[15] out of the fifty-four[16] dams within the state were opened for the first time in history. All five overflow gates of the Idukki Dam were opened at the same time, and for the first time in 26 years, five gates of the Malampuzha dam of Palakkad were opened.[17] Heavy rains in Wayanad and Idukki caused severe landslides and had left the hilly districts isolated.[18][12] The situation was regularly monitored by the National Crisis Management Committee, which also coordinated the rescue and relief operations. The dam openings disrupted many of those living nearby.[19]

With the recurrence of flood events in the state in the subsequent years, several studies have attempted to explain the behavior.

Causes
Rainfall from the southwest monsoon was 23% higher than normal in Kerala in 2018, with August seeing rainfall 96% above normal.[20] On the evening of 8 August, Kerala received heavy rainfall which was 116% more than usual[clarification needed], resulting in dams filling to their maximum capacities. In the proceeding 48 hours, the state received 310 mm (12 in) of rain. Almost all dams had been opened since the water had risen close to overflow levels due to heavy rainfall, which flooded local low-lying areas.[21][22] For the first time in the state's history, 35[15] of its 54[16] dams had been opened. The deluge is considered an impact of global warming.[23][24]

Independent scientific studies conducted by hydrology experts from IIT Madras, Purdue University, and IIT Gandhinagar concluded that heavy downpour and dam management resulted in the floods.[25][26][27] Based on a computer simulation of flood storage and flow patterns by a team of researchers from IIT Madras and Purdue University, it was found that the devastation wrought by the floods cannot be attributed to the release of water from dams. Further, the scientists added that the odds of such floods were 0.06% and no reservoir management could have considered such scenarios.[26] A hydrology expert, researcher from IIT Gandhinagar, Vimal Mishra, identified four major factors for the floods: unexpected above-normal downpour, extreme rainfall events occurring almost across Kerala during the season, over 90% reservoir storage even before the onset of extreme rainfall events, and the unprecedented extreme rainfall in the catchment areas of major reservoirs in the state.[27]

The prime reason for the anomalous rainfall in 2018 is the high-frequency mixed Rossby-gravity waves in the mid-troposphere triggered by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific.[28][24] These high-frequency waves manifested as cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and dilated the wind field to establish zones of convection in the tropics, as they propagated across the Indian Ocean basin. Although the Madden-Julian Oscillation phase with 20-to-40-day period has favored convection in the tropics, the high-frequency mode correlates better with the anomalous precipitation during the intervals of extreme events.[28][24]


IMD daily rainfall anomalies (in millimetres) of 2018 over North, Central, and South Kerala, measured with respect to the seven-year mean precipitation.[24][clarification needed]

5-8 day, 12-20 day and 20-60 day bandpass-filtered IMD rainfall anomalies of 2018 averaged over the state of Kerala.[24][clarification needed]

5-8 days bandpass-filtered ERA5 Meridional velocities of August 2018 meridionally averaged over the state of Kerala at the pressure level 700hPa.[24][clarification needed]

5-8 days bandpass-filtered specific humidity vertically integrated from surface (1000 hPa) to 600 hPa overlaid with 5-8days bandpass-filtered ERA5 winds at 700 hPa from 14 to 17 August 2018.[24][clarification needed]
Expert bodies like the Central Water Commission have corroborated the findings by scientists from IIT Madras, Purdue University and IIT Gandhinagar.[29][30][31]

A report by Adv. Jacob P. Alex, an advisor appointed by the Kerala high court, alleged that the devastating floods of 2018 were the result of bad dam management by the state government.[32][33][34][35] All 79 dams in the state were maintained with the objective to generate hydroelectricity or irrigation and controlling flooding wasn't their purpose. "The major concern of the dam operators was to maximise reservoir levels, which conflicted with the flood control purpose for which the dams could be utilised. The 'flood cushion' of reservoirs – the storage space earmarked in dams to absorb unanticipated high flows – needed review as per the latest guidelines," Alex wrote in his report. "Sudden release of water simultaneously from different reservoirs, during extreme rainfall aggravated the damage," it said, adding that various alerts—blue, orange and red—had been issued not in accordance with the EAP guideline. "No proper follow-up action and effective precautionary steps (especially for evacuating people and accommodating them in safe location) were taken after issuance of Red Alert," it said. As of August 2024, the high court of Kerala had not accepted the report.[36]

The government of Kerala argued in the Supreme Court that the sudden release of water from the Mullaperiyar Dam by the Tamil Nadu government was one of the reasons for the devastating flood in Kerala.[12] The Tamil Nadu government rejected the argument, saying that Kerala suffered the deluge due to the discharge of excess water from 80 reservoirs across Kerala, spurred by heavy rains from within the state; It also argued that the flood surplus from the Idukki dam was due mainly to the flows generated from its own independent catchment due to unprecedented heavy rainfall, while the discharge from the Mullaperiyar dam was significantly less.[37][38]

Impact
The flooded Mullassery Canal, Angamaly
Over 489 people died, 15 are missing and 140 were hospitalized,[6] while The Economic Times reported that 33,000 people were rescued.[39] The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority had placed the state on red alert as a result of the intense flooding.[40] A number of water treatment plants were forced to cease pumping water, resulting in poor access to clean water, especially in northern districts of the state.[41] Over 3,274 relief camps[7] were opened at various locations to accommodate the flood victims. It is estimated by the National Disaster Management Authority that 1,247,496 people[7] found shelter in such camps.[42][43] The flooding affected hundreds of villages, destroyed an estimated 10,000 km (6,200 mi) of roads, and thousands of homes have were damaged or destroyed.[40] The government cancelled Onam celebrations and reallocated the funds to relief efforts.[44]

On 12 August, Cochin International Airport, India's fourth busiest in terms of international traffic and the busiest in the state, suspended all operations until 29 August, following runway flooding.[3] All schools throughout the state were closed, and tourists were dissuaded or prohibited from some districts due to safety concerns.[45] The Kochi Metro closed briefly on 16 August, and later offered free services to aid those affected by the flooding.[46] Due to heavy rain and rising water levels the southern railway suspended train services on the Thiruvananthapuram-Kottayam-Ernakulam and Ernakulam-Shoranur-Palakkad sections.[47]

Government
The central government launched a large search and rescue operation that included aircraft, boats, rescue and medical teams, and police. The government provided supplies to those who needed help and conducted many rescue operations.[19][48][49][50][51]

Public
WhatsApp groups sprung up as control centers that coordinated help and support across various areas.[52] Many people volunteered to deliver supplies and materials, or donated money.[53]

Rescue operation by fishermen
According to the government, a total of 4,537 fishermen communities from Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram districts participated in the rescue operation with 669 fishing boats. They managed to rescue more than 65,000 people from various districts. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan honoured the fishermen. Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma said that the government would provide financial aid to repair the fishing boats which were partially damaged in the rescue operations while new ones will be provided for those boats which were completely destroyed. According to estimates, seven boats were completely destroyed, while 452 were partially destroyed.[54][55][56][57][58]

Relief and monetary aid
Government, NGOs and NPOs
The Government of Kerala started a donation website for flood victims.[59] As of 7 January 2020, approximately ₹4,740 crore (US$639.68 million) was collected from the public including organisations, corporate firms and famous personalities.[60]
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a sum of ₹500 crore (US$73.11 million) as interim relief for Kerala on 18 August 2018. This is in addition to ₹562.45 crore (US$82.24 million) already made available in SDRF of the State and ₹100 crore (US$14.62 million) announced on 12 August 2018 by the Home Minister.[61][62] The central government also said in its press release that this ₹600 crore (US$87.73 million) is only the advance assistance and that additional funds will be released by the NDRF when an inter-ministerial team visits again and assesses the damage.[19][63] The central government, in one of the largest rescue operations, deployed 40 helicopters, 31 aircraft, 500 boats, 182 rescue teams and 18 medical teams of defence forces, 58 teams of NDRF and 7 companies of Central Armed Police Forces. Together they saved over 60,000 human lives.[64]
The European Union announced an assistance of ₹1.53 crore (€160,000) in aid[65][66] funding to the Indian Red Cross Society for providing relief to flood-affected people in Kerala.[67]
The Governments of Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand and Qatar extended condolences and offered humanitarian assistance and monetary aid.[68][69][70]
In a gesture of solidarity with the State government's flood relief efforts, the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) donated ₹1 crore (US$146,221.28) to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund. KCBC President and Archbishop of Thiruvananthapuram Latin Archdiocese, Bishop Dr. Soosa Pakiam, presented the contribution to the Chief Minister's office. The Archbishop also mentioned that Caritas India, the social service wing of CBCI, along with the Catholic Churches of Kerala is undertaking special relief projects like housing to aid the victims.[71]
The KCBC in its Winter Session reviewed that as of December 2018 the Catholic Churches of Kerala has spent ₹164 crore (US$23.98 million) for flood reliefs and that 36.5 acres of land was mobilized for the landless with the cooperation of various dioceses and its religious congregations. The Winter session reviewed rehabilitation progress the Church is carrying out for the flood victims.[72]
Mata Amritanandamayi Math donated ₹10 crore (US$1.46 million) to the Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund, in addition to providing relief materials and helping in rescue operations.[73]
The Guruvayur Devaswom Board donated ₹5 crore (US$731,106.38) to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF). However, on a case filed by its devotee, the Kerala High Court, in December 2020, ruled that the ₹10 crore (US$1.42 million) the state government received from the board (including donations from 2018 and 2019 floods) should be returned. The court argued that temple funds should prioritize the development of the shrine and its allied services. The Guruvayur Devaswom Board challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, which has ordered a status quo on the matter until further review.[74][75]
37,000 volunteers from the People's Foundation, an NGO based in Calicut, with the support of Ideal Relief Wing Kerala cleaned 11,139 houses and conducted 494 relief camps for flood victims.[76]
A fundraising campaign started via the Federation of Malayalee Associations of Americas (FOMAA) 2018–2020 leadership, later migrating to Facebook procured over 260 donors from across the world and was able to raise enough money to build more than forty homes and dedicate various villages across districts of Kerala.[77][78]
A fundraising campaign started on Facebook by charitable organisations Knanaya Catholic Yuvajanavedhi of Chicago and Care and Share along with a person named Arun Simon Nellamattom and others raised and donated US$1.6 million to Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund.[79][80]
IsraAid, an Israeli NGO sent relief workers to distribute supplies and assess needs for clean water, sanitation, and psychological care.[81][82]
Many Members of Parliament, Members of State Legislative Assemblies and Councils, civil servants and Government employees across the country have also donated their one month's salary and/or allowances towards Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund.[83][84][85]
Chief Ministers of all the states (and Delhi) pledged monetary aid from their respective state funds in addition to dispatch of various relief materials such as potable water, blankets, packed food, rice, water-purifying machines, daily-use and healthcare products.

Response

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi being received by the Governor of Kerala P. Sathasivam and the Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, on his arrival, in Kochi, to survey the flood-affected areas, on 18 August 2018.
At a press conference on 11 August, Chief Secretary Tom Jose said, "Things are well under control. The government is on top of the situation."[153] Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted an aerial survey and offered federal support to Keralites. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan described the floods as "something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala."[45]

International
The United States embassy urged its citizens to avoid traveling to the affected areas.[154] The UAE embassy in India issues warning for its citizens regarding the flood. The embassy also said that the weather agencies in India had given warnings regarding heavy rainfall in the southern state of Kerala.[155] UAE's President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan ordered the formation of a national emergency committee to provide relief assistance to people affected by flash floods in the Indian state of Kerala.[156]

A controversy arose from an offer of US$100 million in aid from the UAE.[157] The Kerala Chief Minister's office wrote "CM Pinarayi Vijayan informed that the United Arab Emirates will provide Kerala an assistance of ₹700 Crore. Kerala has a special relationship with UAE, which is a home away from home for Malayalees. We express our gratitude to UAE for their support. #KeralaFloodRelief". The Ministry of External Affairs of India clarified that they received no such offer for financial help from any country, and the UAE Ambassador to India declared that no official announcement had been made.[158][159]

Analysis by Central Water Commission
Kerala as a whole
According to a study by the Central Water Commission, the average cumulative rainfall of 3 days from 15 to 17 August 2018 was about 414 mm. This was almost of the same order as that of rainfall of Devikulam which occurred during 16–18 July 1924. Assuming a runoff coefficient of 0.75, the runoff generated by 3 days of intense rainfall was estimated to be 12057 MCM for the entire state of Kerala. This huge runoff was beyond the carrying capacity of most of the rivers in Kerala, resulting in bank overflows from most of the rivers.[162] The total catchment area tapped by dams in Kerala, excluding barrages is about 6,610 km2 (2,552 sq mi). The runoff generated from the catchment tapped by these dams during the period 15–17 August 2018 was estimated at 2.19 BCM, out of a total runoff of 12 BCM for the whole of Kerala. As per the study, with a total live storage in the state of 5.8 BCM and assuming a live storage availability of 20% on 14 August 2018, the extent of available flood moderation would have only been 1.16 BCM against an estimated inflow of 2.19 BCM. It was therefore essential to make releases from the reservoirs.[163]

The study stated that the dams in Kerala neither added to the flood nor helped in reduction of flood, as most of the dams were already at or very close to FRL on 14 August 2018. Even if the reservoirs had been a few feet below FL, the flooding conditions would not have changed much as the heavy rainfall continued for 3–4 days. It would have been necessary to release water from the reservoirs after the first day of heavy rainfall.[162]

The study concluded it would be necessary to review the rule curves of all reservoirs in Kerala, especially those with a live storage capacity of more than 200 MCM. This would help to create a dynamic flood cushion for moderating floods.[162]

Periyar Basin

This section provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject. Please help improve the article by providing more context for the reader. (August 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
From 15 to 17 August 2018, the rainfall depth realized in the Periyar basin was 588 mm. The maximum discharge passing through the Periyar at Neeleeswaram was 8800 m3/sec, recorded at 16 August 15:00 hrs, according to the CWC's Neeleeswaram G&D site. The major storage reservoirs in the Periyar basin are the Idukki reservoir (1.4 BCM) and the Idamalayar reservoir (1.1 BCM). The peak release on 16 August 2018 from the Idukki reservoir was 1500 m3/sec against an inflow of 2532 m3/sec, thus achieving a flood moderation of 1032 m3/sec. The release from Idamalayar on 16 August 2018 was 963 m3/sec against an inflow of 1164 m3/sec.[162]

The discharge at Neeleshwaram on 17 August 2018 was 8600 m3/sec. The release from Idukki and Idamalayar reservoirs were 1500 m3/sec (with an inflow of 1610 m3/sec) and 1272 m3/sec (inflow of 1007 m3/sec). CWC's analysis found that the releases of water were controlled releases as the discharge capacity of Idukki and Idamalayar dams are 5013 m3/sec and 3012 m3/sec, respectively.[162]

Immediate drought after the flood
A few days after receiving one of the highest rainfalls in century, Kerala was caught under the threat of severe drought. Water level in wells, ponds and rivers recorded lowest levels and some wells even collapsed.[164][165] Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan directed the state council for Science, Technology & Environment to carry out studies on the phenomenon after floods across the state, and suggest possible solutions to the problem.[166][167]

A.B. Anita, executive director of the Centre for Water Resource Development Management (CWRDM), an autonomous research institution under the State government, said heavy run-off of the top soil in the upland areas and the siltation in the rivers were the reasons for the falling water level.[168] The top soil in the hills and upland areas were removed in the flash floods to a depth of up to two metres in many places. As the top soil was shaved off, it ruined the hills' capacity to sponge in rainwater, she said. Ms. Anita cited ecological destruction caused by deforestation, harmful land use in the upland areas and sand mining in the streams and rivers as having contributed to the top soil run-off and siltation. This was exacerbated by the impact of climate change at the macro level.

Echoing her views, experts at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C) said it was usual for the water level in the rivers and domestic wells to fall after fluvial floods. "Normally, a river flows through the sand of its own bearing till the mouth. However, this time the discharge has been full, taking the sand and the rocks in the youth-stage along with the floods. So the water level in the rivers comes down. And when the river water level is reduced, the groundwater table also does not get replenished since the rivers and groundwater table are connected," said K. Saseendran a geologist and professor at the NIT-C.[169]

IRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state will submit its report on the total loss occurred in the heavy floods that swept across the state las month on Thursday. The total loss has been pegged at Rs 40,000 crore said industry minister E P Jayarajan.
He said that the state cannot determine the loss based on the Centre’s criteria. The state will submit the report on the total loss sector wise and will demand adequate compensation from the Centre.
Already from various departments of the Centre the state has received Rs 1000 crore as assistance which includes Rs 600 crore announced during the visit of the Prime Minister and Union home minister.

Rs 4 lakh compensation announced to the families of flood victims will be disbursed soon. As per the final reports 488 people were killed in the floods. The immediate compensation of Rs 10,000 announced has been disbursed to 5.10 lakh families till date. There has been no complaint on the disbursement of this compensation from any distict, said the minister.
The cabinet sub committee formed to monitor the rehabilitation works has decided to speed up the disbursement of compensation to the families of the victims. However the compensation for the people who have lost their lands and house has not been finalised. This will be finalised only after getting the reports from the district collectors. Since many people and organisations have come forward in donating houses and for providing land for the people to set up the houses, the district collectors have been asked to prepare a detailed report on the exact number that has to be constructed. Once this report is finalised the compensation and its disbursement will be announced.
The World Bank and ADB teams are in the state to review the total loss in different districts. The state government has submitted a proposal before them. The final decision on the amount to be awarded to the state will be taken by them soon.Worst floods in nearly a century kill 44 in India's Kerala state amid torrential monsoon rains

At least 44 people have died after days of torrential monsoon rains triggered the worst floods in nearly a century in the southern Indian state of Kerala.

Tens of thousands of people have been forced to abandon their homes in the popular tourist state, where a major airport has shut and trains have been severely disrupted.

The latest five deaths came on Wednesday after authorities were forced to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending it surging into overflowing rivers.

Flooding has destroyed or damaged houses and caused significant losses to crops in the state, known for its spices and coffee.

The army has been deployed to help evacuate people in the worst affected areas, with more than 50,000 people forced to take shelter in relief camps.

The Indian Meteorological Department has warned heavy rains were set to continue until Saturday and issued a “red alert” for 12 out of the Kerala’s 14 districts.

The international airport in Kochi, a major port city, has suspended all flights until Saturday afternoon after its runway flooded.

Kerala is popular among tourists for its scenic landscapes, waterfalls and beaches.

Authorities have asked visitors to stay away from popular destinations including the Munnar hill station.

Sabarimala, a Hindu shrine in the mountain ranges of Pathanamthitta district which attracts around 45 million pilgrims a year, has been closed due to the swollen waters of the nearby Pamba river.

“Presently, 35 reservoirs in the state are releasing water. Many districts in the state are facing floods,” said Pinarayi Vijayan, the state’s chief minister.

Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, a senior official with the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, said the seasonal rains had killed more than 200 people in the state since May.

Officials said 44 people had died since 8 August.

Torrential rain kills hundreds of people every year in India, where the monsoon season runs from June to September, but Kerala has not seen such devastating flooding since 1924.

During the special Assembly session convened to discuss the relief and rehabilitation measures underway to cope with the state’s worst floods in a century, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan informed the House that a total of 483 people lost their lives in rain-related incidents this monsoon. While 14 people are reported to be still missing, around 140 people were admitted to hospitals during this period.

Vijayan, who deferred his trip to the US for medical treatment scheduled for earlier this month to lead his administration’s rehabilitation exercise, said the losses due to the floods and landslides are more than the state’s annual plan. In the 2017-18 fiscal year, Kerala’s annual plan outlay was pegged at Rs 26,500 crore.

“The rescue operations which took place at the height of the monsoon are without comparison. To all those who sacrificed their lives to help others, who took brave and daring steps to rescue one another, we want to offer a big salute,” the chief minister said in his speech.


“The rescue operations are over, rehabilitation measures are continuing and rebuilding of the state is left,” he added.

The CM also said that the government would explore the possibility of legal options to avail the funds offered to the state, including that from abroad. His statement assumes significance in the wake of a row over the Centre’s refusal to accept the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) reported offer of Rs 700 crore to the flood-ravaged state.

Festive offer
“Offers of financial assistance for Kerala are pouring in from different quarters of the world. The government is also moving towards legal steps to avail these funds,” Vijayan said.

On August 21, when the monsoon took its fiercest form, a total of 14.5 lakh people belonging to 3.91 lakh families had to be rushed to nearby relief camps. Many others moved to their relatives’ homes when their houses got flooded. Today, the number of relief camps has come down to 305, which together account for 59,296 people belonging to 16,767 families. A sum of Rs 10,000 will be offered to every family who had to take refuge at the relief camps. The funds for compensation have already been released to the respective district collectors from the chief minister’s distress relief fund. Free kits containing essential items like rice, atta, sugar and clothes are also being distributed to those returning home from the camps.

The chief minister made it clear that the economic impact of the floods was immense with a large number of small and medium-scale enterprises being heavily affected by the floodwaters. The agricultural production of the state has also been hit, with 57,000 hectares of crops damaged.

“The government is optimistic that there will be creative discussions with all parties in this House regarding the rebuilding of the state,” he said.

At the same time, VD Satheeshan, KPCC vice-president and Congress MLA, termed the floods a ‘man-made disaster’ for which accountability must be fixed as soon as possible. He said no preliminary tests were conducted to examine the impact of the opening and closing of dam shutters on the state’s rivers, especially during high tide and low tide. He, however, promised the government that there will be complete cooperation from the Opposition in the rebuilding of Kerala.

As a Bangladeshi Hindu living in India, I would like to offer my support to a fellow democracy struggling against radical Islamist terrorism

According to Cicero, “A true friend is more to be esteemed than kinfolk.” On this day more than ever, this statement reflects the reality that stands behind Indian-Israeli relations.
Horrific floods have struck Kerala, India. Nearly 400 people have been killed and thousands of people remain stranded. For the state of Kerala, this is literally the worst flood of the century. At this critical juncture, India needs friends more than ever, and Israel, a true friend of India, is once again coming to the rescue.
IsraAid, an Israeli humanitarian organization, has sent an emergency response team to help. They will distribute blankets, tents and other items of critical importance to the Kerala flood victims. This team will assess the “long-term psychological, water, sanitation and hygiene needs in the affected communities.” According to the Times of Israel, the emergency response team includes experienced members of IsraAid Nepal, who have received extensive training in humanitarian relief and last year responded to flooding in Nepal.”

As a Hindu residing in India, this gesture of friendship from Israel means the world to me and many others in India. It shows us who our true friends are and demonstrates that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was correct when he decided to warm up India’s relationship with Israel.
Of course, Hindu India has much in common with the State of Israel. Both Hindu India and Jewish Israel are ancient nations with deep roots to their ancestral homelands, and whose very existence upsets the radical Islamists merely due to the warped radical belief that any land that at one point in time belonged to Muslims must always belong to Muslims. Just as the Indian victims of Pakistani terrorism are not getting the limelight they deserve in the West, Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorism suffer a similar fate. 
And Hindus both in Pakistan and Bangladesh are treated in an abhorrent manner, just as the Jews in Muslim countries are. The dead body of Sabuj Biswas, a minority college student, was recently found in Bangladesh. Biswas was murdered by someone associated with the ruling Awami League government. Hindus in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan suffer from murders, rapes, the destruction and seizure of land and property, the desecration of holy sites, incitement and more on a daily basis.  
SIMILARLY, JEWS in Muslim countries like Turkey and Iran also face intense discrimination. According to Turkish journalist Uzay Bulut, some Turks are even using the recent crisis in US-Turkish relations as an opportunity to spread antisemitic conspiracy theories. Such incitement often can lead to violence, as was demonstrated by the attack on the Neve Shalom Synagogue in Turkey last year. Thus, we Hindus feel the pain experienced by Jews in Muslim countries.  
On top of that, both India and Israel are democracies that respect human rights and minority rights, even though both nations suffered unspeakable horrors following the implementation of partition plans.  During the partition of India, several hundred thousand people were killed, at least 75,000 women were raped, 83,000 women were abducted, many non-Muslims were forcefully converted to Islam and 12 million people became refugees. We Hindus from the Bengal region are still living in the shadow of the Noakhali riots of 1946 and the Great Calcutta Killings, as we witness our Muslim neighbors in Bangladesh – including a Bangladeshi minister and MP –commemorating Indian Independence Day as a day of mourning, even though Sheikh Mujib (the father of Sheikh Hasina) did not really want Bangladeshi Independence and sought to be prime minister of Pakistan.  
The Jews of Israel also suffered immensely in 1948, when the land was partitioned between Jews and Arabs. The massacre of the Hadassah medical convoy and the horrific atrocities committed during the siege of the Old City of Jerusalem during Israel’s War of Independence highlight this point immensely. And with the rocket attacks and incendiary kite terrorist attacks, Israel is still living in the shadow of such atrocities. 
I see an uncanny parallel between Muslims who mourn India’s Independence Day and Muslims who mourn Israel’s Independence Day. As certain Israeli Arabs look to establish an International Israeli Apartheid Day, as a foreign observer, I see that Israel, like India, is still struggling against those who cannot tolerate her right to exist. This is quite unfortunate. 
However, as a Bangladeshi Hindu living in India, I would like to offer my support to a fellow democracy struggling against radical Islamist terrorism, which has always been there for India during her hour of need. And I would like to say thank you to the State of Israel from the bottom of my heart for helping Kerala state.

Materials and Methods
GPS processing
We processed 5-Hz continuous GPS data from six stations in Nepal (Figure 1) at
distances of 60 to 230 km from the epicenter for the day of the mainshock (April 25).
Final GPS satellite orbits, Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs) and 0.2 Hz GPS satellite
clocks from CODE (Center for Orbit Determination in Europe,
ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/CODE/2015/) were fixed to estimate 30 s fractional-cycle biases
(FCBs) with a reference network of 43 stations located over 1000 km from Nepal. We
then fixed the orbits, clocks and ERPs from the network solution to enable precise point
positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR)(35) stations to estimate epoch-wise
positions, zenith troposphere delay (ZTD) parameters, receiver clocks and phase
ambiguities for all seven high-rate stations. All position estimates are with respect to the
International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) positions and are not contaminated
by any displaced reference stations. No constraints between epochs are applied to the
positions, while ZTDs are estimated as random walk parameters with a power density of
0.001 mm/s1/2. All eligible ambiguities were resolved successfully and at least six
ambiguities are fixed at each epoch. Solid Earth tides, ocean tide loading and pole tide
are applied and antenna phase center variations are used. According to the scatter of 10
minutes of pre-event positions, the position precision (one-sigma) is about 5 mm for the
horizontal and 10 mm for the vertical components for all stations.
InSAR processing
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from the Japanese
Aerospace Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) were
processed using GMTSAR (36) and unwrapped using SNAPHU (37). Images were
acquired over the epicentral area on February 22 and May 3 (Descending Path 48). The
perpendicular baseline was 56 m; this value is sufficiently small that errors in the SRTM1 dataset used to remove the topographic phase do not contribute significantly to the
residual. The data were acquired in Wide Swath (ScanSAR) mode which enables a swath
width of 350 km, but requires precise burst alignment during operation of the satellite.
ScanSAR interferometry was successfully employed for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake
(38) using manually aligned bursts, but ALOS-2 is the first L-band satellite to acquire
burst-aligned ScanSAR imagery as a standard operating mode. We processed the Level
1.1 single-look-complex (SLC) imagery for each of the five sub-swaths using GMTSAR,
which includes a 5-parameter alignment of the slave image to the master based on crosscorrelation, and applied a 500m Gaussian lowpass filter to improve coherence. The
resulting interferograms have phase that matches at the sub-swath boundaries despite
being independently processed. We unwrapped each sub-swath using SNAPHU and then
combined the sub-swaths into a single image by adding a multiple of 2π to ensure
matching phase at the boundaries. The final result contains a linear ramp related to orbital
error, which we removed using the best-fitting plane to data outside the deforming
region. Finally we subsampled the data using the quad tree technique (39) and a total of
2230 InSAR LOS points contributed to the joint inversion.

Kinematic slip inversion
We used the main nodal plane from the USGS W-phase moment tensor solution
with a strike of 295° and dip of 11° to define the faulting surface (6). The assumed fault
was discretized into 300 10x10 km subfaults. Elastodynamic Green’s functions at the 5
Hz GPS sample rate were computed for every subfault/station pair using the frequency
wavenumber integration technique of Zhu and Rivera (40). Since velocity data are more
sensitive to rupture kinematics (23) we differentiated the GPS displacement time series to
velocity and low-pass filtered them with a 4 pole Butterworth filter with corner frequency
at 1 Hz. It is important to note that differentiation of the GPS data would not be effective
at lower sampling rates such as 1 Hz. Joint inversion of the velocity waveforms, GPS
static offsets and InSAR LOS static offsets was carried out using the multi-time window
method with three-knot splines (isosceles triangles) as basis functions (Ide et al. 1996).
The accelerometric record from KATNP was not included in the inversion because it has
no absolute timing. The inversion is carried out using non-negative least squares and the
rake is constrained to values between 45 and 135. In order to model the complexity of the
subfault source time functions, we allowed slip on twenty 50% overlapping triangles with
1 s rise time. With this parametrization each subfault was allowed to slip for a total of 10
s. Spatial regularization was achieved though minimum norm smoothing; constraints
were placed on the L2 norm of the model parameter vector. Temporal smoothing on the
time windows was achieved with a simple first-order forward finite difference stencil.
The optimal level of spatial and temporal smoothing was determined through Akaike’s
Bayesian Information Criterion (41).
The GPS velocity waveforms and InSAR LOS and GPS static offsets were weighted
equally by dividing each data set by the norm of the vector containing the observations.
We assumed the NEIC reported hypocentral location and time (28.147°N 84.708°E;
2015-04-25 06:11:26.270 UTC). Maximum rupture speed was constrained through trial
and error (Figure S4); we find that 3.3 km/s yields the best fit to the data (Figure S4).
This does not mean that slower rupture speeds are not possible; in this case early time
windows will simply have little or no slip. However, rupture at earlier times than the time
it would take a rupture front propagating outward from the hypocenter at 3.3 km/s was
not allowed. To avoid a possible bias in the determination of the source due to
amplification by site effects, we cropped the waveform at station NAST to include only
the main pulse and we down weighted the horizontal components which are most
affected by site effects (Figure 4).
The stress drop from the resulting slip model was estimated by computing internal
strains on the fault (42) assuming a half space with a rigidity of 32 GPa; this corresponds
to the rigidity of the layer where most of the slip occurs.
Temporal resolution and inversion calibration
There are three important questions with regards to the inversion setup which affect
our conclusions: 1) Whether the observed data can be explained by variability in other
aspects of the source kinematics, 2) Whether the inversion parametrization into 20 50%
overlapping splines (triangles) is adequate in discerning the potential slip-rate time
functions (STFs) at the individual subfaults and 3) Whether the station geometry is
adequate for assessing the characteristics of the STFs, i.e., whether STF resolution is
equal on all parts of the fault model.
4
To investigate these questions we produced an ensemble of 25 synthetic scenario
ruptures. The background slip distribution for all the synthetic models is the same. It is
obtained from the inversion of just the static data (InSAR+GPS) and the result is shown
in Figure S9. We then turned this static model into a kinematic one by letting rupture
propagate from the hypocenter at 5 different rupture speeds, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6
km/s. For each rupture speed we also used regularized Yoffe STF with a rise time of 2, 4,
6, 8 and 10s. We assumed that acceleration time to peak slip rate, τs is always 25% of the
rise time. We have thus a total of 25 scenario events, all with the same total slip but
varying in rupture speed and STF rise time. For each synthetic test case we modeled the 5
Hz velocity waveforms at the locations of the GPS stations.
Before analyzing the synthetic models further insight into the likelihood that the
vertical velocity pulse at KKN4 reflects the rise time of the slip function beneath the site
can be gleaned by rotating the seismograms for that site into fault parallel and fault
normal directions (Figure S8). Since the station is only 13 km away from the source it is
to be expected that the ground motions are dominated by intermediate field terms in the
elastodynamic solution. As such, the time taken for the displacements to grow to the final
static offset are directly related to the local rise time. Although the waveforms also
include the contributions of surface waves, it is clear from the waveforms that the
duration of the vertical velocity pulse correlates well with the static field growth.
As noted, a key assumption of this study is that the pulse observed on the vertical
velocity waveform at the bedrock site KKN4 reflects a propagating slip pulse with long
rise time. Figure S9 shows the predicted vertical waveforms at this station for the 25
scenario events. The comparison between the observed data (black trace) and the
synthetics suggests that this assumption is reasonable. Shorter STFs should produce
appreciably higher amounts of high frequency energy that are conspicuously absent in the
observed data, and although the rupture speed has some effect on the synthetics it does
not greatly alter the shape or duration of the main pulse.
To assess whether the temporal parametrization in the inversion is suitable, we add
realistic noise to the synthetic time series for the scenario events and then invert them
with the 20 triangle parametrization. We measure the standard deviation of 60 s of preevent noise at each site and use that to add white Gaussian noise to the time series. We
then invert only the synthetic velocity data (disregarding the InSAR and displacement
data) in an effort to determine if we can recover the subfault STF. We perform the
inversions at 6 different levels of temporal smoothness with the values of the
regularization parameter logarithmically spaced between 10-4 and 101
. An example of the
along strike STFs for different levels of smoothing is shown in Figure S10. The figure
shows that although recovery of the STFs is not perfect, the total duration (the rise time)
of each STF is well constrained. The plot also shows no significant along-strike bias. It
also shows that a temporal smoothing value of 0.01-0.1 is suitable and that the effect of
over smoothing (Figure 10C) is to produce artificially long STFs. This is easily
understood as due to late occurring small amplitude triangles, which are used by the
inversion in an attempt to fit the noise. If the smoothing is too strong the STFs will try to
encompass these artifacts and the resulting STFs are artificially long.
We further test whether the inversion parametrization is sufficient to discern
between STFs of different rise times. Figure S11 shows the STFs inverted for the same
along-strike profile for a rupture velocity of 3.2 km/s and a smoothing value of 0.1 for 4
5
models with different rise-times at 4, 6, 8 and 10 s. Again, recovery of the STFs is not
perfect, but in general for the rise times tested the parametrization is sufficient to
determine the rise times of the individual subfaults.
Thus, the observations at station KKN4 of the pulse in the vertical velocity
waveform, and the obvious absence of high frequency strong shaking along with the
synthetic tests suggest that the event indeed can be characterized by a propagating slip
pulse with a long rise time. Furthermore, the sensitivity tests indicate that while the
shapes of the individual STFs at each subfault are affected by noise, the total duration, or
rise time, of each STF is well constrained by the available network of observing stations.
Aftershocks
The Department of Mines and Geology (DMG), Nepal, operates, in collaboration
with the Departement Analyse Surveillance Environnement (DASE), France, a
nationwide seismic network consisting primarily of 21 vertical component short period
sensors (ZM500) (43). We used the seismicity catalogue of events with local magnitude
ML larger than 4.0 produced by the DMG from the mainshock on April 25 to May 19,
2015, available at www.seismonepal.gov.np. See Pandey et al. (43) and Rajaure et al.
(44) for details of the network and routine location procedure.

with short and long onset times. The STF is somewhat smoothed after propagation from
the source to station KKN4 through the layered media(44), but the smoothing can explain
neither the long pulse duration observed in Figure 3 nor the smooth onset. These tests
suggest that the surficial observation at the Kathmandu sites reflects well the STF on the
fault. The amplitude of surface vertical displacement is about one third of the slip on the
fault and the surface velocity is about 60% of the slip velocity.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report
DRR sitrep 2015‐002 – June 2, 2015
This disaster risk reduction situation report explains the drivers of disaster risks in Nepal and draws
attention to the efforts that have been undertaken to reduce these risks. A key overview of the
background of historical disasters, the calculated risks and the on‐going work on disaster risk
reduction in Nepal are summarized in a previous Preventionweb DRR situation report for Nepal:
http://preventionweb.net/go/44170  
1. Drivers of Disaster Risks in Nepal  
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 and caused massive destruction. The main
quake was followed by numerous aftershocks of magnitude 5 or higher causing further damage and
losses. At the moment, there is little information about the factors that contributed to the growth of
disaster risks in Nepal. Disaster risk, which is the likelihood of the loss of life, injury or destruction
and damage from a disaster in a given period of time, is influenced by the hazard itself, the exposure
of people, property and livelihoods to these hazards, and their susceptibility to the damaging effects
of hazards. Changes in any of these components will either increase or decrease the risks, and when
a disaster strikes they will determine the size of its impacts. This DRR situation report covers the
hazard, exposure and vulnerability that combined to make the earthquake in Nepal so deadly.

1.1) Hazards
Nepal’s landscape, which is predominantly composed of hills and steep mountains combined with
fragile geological formations and heavy monsoon rainfall, leads to wide range of geological and
hydro‐meteorological hazards affecting the country.  In addition, Nepal’s geological characteristics
together with torrential rain during rainy season often result in landslides, debris flows, and floods.  
Statistics from the EM‐DAT show that floods are most frequent hazard, with 50 events reported
from 1900 to 2014. Landslides follow this, with 23 events reported in the same period, then
epidemics, with 17 events. There have been 6 earthquake events registered in the EM‐DAT
database. A study published in April 2015 reported1 that despite the availability of new data and
methodological improvements, the available earthquake hazard map showing the probability of
tremors happening across Nepal is about 20 years old. The study goes on to recommend that an
update to the seismic hazard map is “imperative” as this will be important for policies on building
regulations, insurance, and emergency preparedness.  
1.2) Exposure
Besides the high incidence of hazards in Nepal, there is also a high degree of exposure to these
hazards. The earthquake was focused in the Janakpur Zone of Nepal, which has a population of
2,222,000. There were approximately 5.6 million people within a radius of 100 km, 4.1 million within
75 km and 1.4 million within 50km radius of the epicenter.    This means that a large number of
people were exposed to a high degree of ground shaking.
Out of the country's 23 million population2
, 86 percent lives in rural areas, and 82 percent of the
economically active population works in agriculture, fishing, or forestry. Nepal’s population marked

an increase of 5 million between the 1991 and the 2001 census with an average annual growth rate
of 2.3 percent.  
According to the World Bank3
, the Kathmandu Valley has a population of 2.5 million people and a
population density of about 13,000 people per square kilometers. It is also growing at 4 percent per
year, making it one of the fastest‐growing metropolitan areas in South Asia, and the first region in
Nepal to face rapid urbanization at a metropolitan scale. Figure 1 shows the shake map of the
Gorkha earthquake and the population density. Figure 2 shows the exposed population compared
with the shaking intensity as generated by the Gorkha earthquake.
Kathmandu, followed by Dhanusa, Siraha has the highest percentage of people categorized as being
in the productive age group (15‐59 years old) who are exposed to hazards. There are also a high
proportion of children exposed to the same hazards. In addition to the exposure of people, the
earthquake also affected assets4
. For a 100‐year return period, on average 35 percent of permanent
houses in Nepalese districts were exposed to a very high hazard earthquake zone. Baitadi, Darchula,
Kathmandu, Baglung, Doti were the five districts with the highest percentage of permanent houses
exposed to a very high hazard zone. Other critical infrastructure such as education, health and
transportation were also highly exposed to hazards. For example, 84.8 percent of schools in the
districts of Nepal were in located in hazard prone areas5
. The most exposed schools were found in
Bara, Parsa, Kanchanpur, Illam and Rautahat; these schools were located in the most earthquake
prone areas. For hospitals, 20 districts have 100 percent health post exposure to high hazard zone
areas and another 19 districts have health post exposure to moderate hazard zone areas. Similarly it
has been shown that in more than 20 districts roads were located in hazard prone areas and in 15

districts 100 percent of the roads were located in earthquake prone areas. This increased the overall
exposure of Nepal to the disaster.
1.3) Vulnerability
Another factor that contributes to disaster risks is vulnerability, which is the susceptibility of people,
properties and livelihoods to the damaging effects of the hazard. Historical damage and loss data
provides insights on the vulnerability of people and assets in Nepal. For example, Figure 3 shows
that a large proportion of destructive disasters in Nepal are small‐scale disasters, averaging more
than 90% of all disasters, which cause more death; affects more people; destroy more houses; and
cause more economic damages, as compared to large but infrequent disasters.    This shows that
there is very high vulnerability of both people and assets in Nepal. The Pacific Disasters Center ranks
Nepal as 37 out of 172 countries in its disaster vulnerability index as shown in Figure 4.
Some experts6 noted that Kathmandu was vulnerable to earthquakes due to its high population
density, unplanned development practices, unsafe construction, lack of urban planning, high
incidence of poverty, and high inequality in terms of access to public services. In addition, others7
view the vulnerability of people to hazards such as drought and other adverse weather conditions as
depending on their socio‐economic status. Poor and socially excluded groups will be less able to
absorb shocks than well‐positioned and better‐off households.

A 2007 World Food Programme household survey8 found that the Far‐  and Mid‐West regions in
Nepal are generally considered as the poorest parts of the country, which would indicate high
vulnerability to hazards. The survey showed that in almost 94 percent of the households, drought,
hailstorms, unemployment, illness, landslides and death of a family member created food shortage.
In addition, it revealed that in drought‐affected areas, average household food grain stocks would
deplete six times faster than in non‐drought‐affected areas. This means that hazards directly
affected the well‐being of populations, which made the same populations more vulnerable to future
disasters and increased the change of a hazard becoming a disaster.
The existing stock of Nepal’s infrastructure is also vulnerable to hazards. For example, a survey of
close to 1,000 building structures in the year 2000 by JICA under the Study on Earthquake Disaster
Mitigation of Kathmandu Valley (SEDM) project found that in Kathmandu valley, owners construct
most of the buildings themselves both in the rural and urban areas. Although there are significant
increases in the suburban area of the number of buildings constructed by contractors, majority of
the existing housing are owner‐built. This is shown in Figure 5.
In 2008, Amod Dixit of the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) reported9 that:  
“combining building construction process as well as the mode of transmission of the construction, it can be
found out that less than 10 percent of the buildings are engineered which is constructed by engineers, and
over 90 percent are non-engineered, by craftsmen or local masons. In terms of pre-construction investment
on the other hand, [little] investment has been done to majority craftsmen whereas there are a lot of
training and fostering process for engineers and even for sub engineers. That is, practically, there is no
investment for production of qualified construction workers in Nepal. Therefore, thinking about key
stakeholders in housing construction in Nepal, whereas there are clients (owners), consultant which in

2) Efforts to Reduce Disaster Impacts  
Although the real impact of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal will not be fully known before the post‐ 
disaster needs assessment (PDNA), estimates are already being made about the potential impact.
The speculation on the impact of the disaster is mostly based on the country’s vulnerability to the
earthquake.
2.1) Effects on the People
As of 18 May 2015, the reported death toll was10 8,604 and the total number of injured,16,808. A
2002 study by JICA outlines a possible disaster scenario for an earthquake striking in central Nepal.
JICA estimated a possible death toll of 18,000 mostly from house collapses, with the estimated
number of people injured around 147,000 due to building collapse and falling objects.  
One reason for this difference is that
this earthquake is not the worst case
for the capital, Kathmandu. If for
example there was a repeat of the
1934 great Bihar‐Nepal earthquake
today, the predictions above may
actually exceed the impact of the
earthquake, as noted in an analysis
by Geohazards International (GHI) in
199911.  
Since 2009, the Nepal Risk Reduction
Consortium (NRRC) have been
training close to 2,000 masons and
have provided technical training in
seismic resilience for Engineers and
specialists. In addition, the NRRC has
assisted the government building
code compliance strategy, including supporting the digitization of the permit approval process and
GIS mapping of all buildings in Kathmandu Valley. These together with other measures to improve
disaster preparedness and response capacity of various stakeholders most likely also contributed to
the reduced mortality in this disaster. Photo 1 shows female masons training conducted by
Kathmandu Metropolitan City.
  
2.2) Effects on the Economy
The Finance Ministry of Nepal has reported that country suffered a loss of up to US$10 billion due to
the earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks. This represents up to half of the country’s US$ 20
billion GDP. Chairing a meeting of donor agencies, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said that the
preliminary estimated cost for the reconstruction of the quake‐ravaged country is US$5 billion and
works have been started by setting up a fund of US$2 billion for the time being.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report   Page 7
This article12 reports that based on historical earthquakes in and around Nepal and then using the
change in values of buildings and intensities seen in the 2015 earthquake the loss is expected to be
around US$3 billion to US$3.5 billion and around a US$5 billion to US$5.5 billion replacement cost.
These costs do not yet include the cost of building back better structures.
Additional indirect losses to the tourism industry and the value of cultural structures are yet to be
calculated. Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of the total economy, and there are calculations
that the Gorkha earthquake may cost around US$1.5 billion per year in indirect losses to Nepal due
to loss in tourism.
Also, insurers will only cover a fraction of losses, despite the massive direct economic losses.
According to the Insurance Information Institute, less than US$3.50 is spent per capita annually in
Nepal on property and casualty insurance, versus the nearly US$2,300 spent each year in the U.S.
Nepal’s insurers collected premiums of about US$277 million in 2013, with most of those funds for
life coverage. Insurance is one means to reduce the economic vulnerability to a disaster. Opinions13
have been written on why this option may be considered in the future to reduce the vulnerability of
Nepal’s economy to future risks. Considering the country’s current social and economic structure,
micro‐credit can catalyze the local economy and make needed produce more readily available
locally.  
In addition, 2.2 million Nepalese who work overseas sent remittances that are equivalent to more
than 25% of Nepal’s GDP in 2014, and these represent close to double the value of export of goods
and services of Nepal. The World Bank in a 2009 study14 found a link between remittances and
disasters, where it noted that “migrant remittance flows increase in the aftermath of natural
disasters, macroeconomic or financial crises, and act as a safety net for households that have
migrants abroad.” There is scope for remittances to help economic recovery if it is also invested in
education or in business development and used not just as a household safety net for daily family
expenses, which at present is reported to take up close to 80% of remittances.15 Figure 6 shows that
the personal remittances received as a percent of national GDP in Nepal is second largest in the
world just behind those for Kyrgyz Republic.

2.3) Effects on Infrastructure and cultural heritage
According to the Department of Education, 14,500 classrooms were destroyed in the  earthquake.
Since the catastrophe took place on a Saturday instead of a school day, this avoided thousands of
deaths among schoolchildren. National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) reports that out of
35,000 public and private schools, only 350 to 400 have been retrofitted. ADB also reports16 that 160
public school buildings survived the earthquake in Kathmandu Valley because they were part of a
school safety program, which includes retrofitting.
The Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium in its progress review in 201317 notes that an action plan is in
place for the assessment of 1,800 school buildings in the Kathmandu Valley. In addition the
Consortium reports that 65 school buildings retrofitted to date and a plan in place for the retrofitting
an additional 260 school buildings. The re‐construction of 280 school buildings is also ongoing. Also,
156 masons have been reported trained so far out of 1,050 targeted under the programme. Out of
the 162 schools damaged from the Sikkim earthquake in September 2011, 70 school blocks
reconstructed, 31 retrofitted, and work have been initiated in 48 of the remaining 53 blocks to be
completed soon. Figure 7 shows the 4,500 schools and their location which are potentially affected
by the Gorkha earthquake.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report   Page 9
It have been reported that 400 health posts, or community health centres were destroyed in the
2015 Gorkha earthquake, with an additional 300 damaged and three district hospitals which
collapsed. However, the World Health Organization reported18 that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake and
its aftershocks failed to disrupt the services at Kathmandu’s largest public hospitals, including
Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Patan Hospital, Civil Service Hospital, Birendra Army
Hospital and the trauma centre at Bir Hospital.  
These hospitals have been retrofitted for safety, which involves everything from repairing cracks in
walls to installing seismic belts and roof bracing, and has been a core part of preparedness plans.
The WHO further reported that these retrofitted hospitals went through a process of prioritization,
where emergency rooms, maternity wards, and operating theatres were some of the first areas
where retrofitting was applied. In addition it was also noted that the response to the earthquake by
health care providers was resilient because of pre‐planning and training initiatives under the WHO‐
supported Hospital Preparedness for Emergency Programme.  
Similar experiences have also been reported elsewhere. For example, it has been reported that the
Chhatrapati Free Clinic (CFC) in Kathmandu didn’t suffer damage in the recent earthquake, despite
the building being built back in 1962 and three floors were added in 1985. This was because three
years ago, the owner decided to retrofit the building costing him 40 per cent of constructing a new
building. As a result, the clinic was able to treat hundreds of people injured in the earthquake and
provided shelter to many who lost their homes. Figure 8 shows the 699 health clinics and their
location, which are potentially affected by the Gorkha earthquake.

It is important to take note that economic losses will be much less when a robust safe schools and
hospitals program is in place. Last but not least, much of the social life in communities takes place
around these vital structures, and when these remain intact, will help communities to quickly regain
pace in recovering and organizing themselves.
The earthquake damaged a
large number of cultural and
heritage sites in Nepal.
Outside of Kathmandu, a
number of such    sites and
structures survived the
earthquake and its
aftershocks, including the
Boudhanath and
Swayambunath.  
A crowd map19 as shown in
Figure 9 was developed by
ICCROM and shows
reported damages to
cultural heritage sites in
Nepal after the earthquake.
A report20 analysing the 141
entries in this crowd map
notes that 68 entries
mention sites that have collapsed completely. An additional 56 entries mention major structural
damage, which means that these sites are at particular risk as their situation could worsen with
another aftershock. The rest of the entries mention medium or minor damage to heritage, or they
refer to salvage, cleaning or protection efforts.
Within Kathmandu in Durbar Square, a large number of iconic sites and structures were destroyed,
though a few survived, including Taleju and Jannath temples, the Kumari House, and the
Pashupatinath Temple.  The list of destroyed cultural and historic structures been reported to have
been completely destroyed include Kasthamandap, Maju Dega    and Narayan Vishnu Temples,
Trailokya Mohan, Krishna (Chasin Dega), Dharahara (Bhimsen Tower), Hari Shankar, Jagan Narayan,
Fasidega Temple, and Vatsala Durga Temple.
Many temples and monuments that were restored in the recent past performed much better in this
earthquake, and also there were many historic structures that were resilient because of their design,
the type materials of used and the engineering of their construction. They performed well on past
earthquakes and again in this one. The Pashupatinath Temple, which withstood this earthquake, has
been renovated a number of times recently and by design is not very tall, and is made of brick as
opposed to mortar, with walls that are held together by a roof made of metal sheets.  
The above impacts provide an insight to some lessons learned in reducing risks to infrastructures ‐ 
retrofitting, good design and engineering, and use of good building materials all support resilient
infrastructures. Supporting with proper capacities of users and service providers ensure that these
infrastructures are operational after disasters.

3) Conclusions
To understand Nepal’s risk to disasters in the future, it is necessary to better understand the
underlying drivers of these risks. Given the fact that Nepal has a high level of frequent hazards,
exposure and vulnerability the country is still very much at risk for future disasters.  
Looking at the impact of the earthquake the report explains that the earthquake largely affected the
Nepalese economy, in terms of its infrastructure, tourism, cultural heritage, schools and hospitals.  
These will also be key areas in building back better after the disaster. There is a lot of scope to build
back better than before and to ensure that the risks are not rebuilt for future generations to suffer
from again.

A Devastating Disaster: A Case Study of Nepal Earthquake and
Its Impact on Human Beings
Sourav Dey
(Department of Geography, Thakur Panchanan Mahila Mahavidyalaya and Dewanhat Mahavidyalaya, India)
Abstract: Earthquake is one of the deadly natural disasters we have regularly experienced. Nepal and its
adjacent areas are vulnerable to very high magnitude of earthquake. The Himalayan belt, Bihar- Nepal border,
Assam and North Bengal especially Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts fall in this
seismic zone. On the basis of investigation it has been found that recent earthquakes had destructed many
human lives and their properties in Nepal and north India. The earthquake was considered to be the main cause
for avalanches, landslides, slumps, many creaks and fissures in the adjacent area of Nepal. The present study
endeavours to examine the nature, extent, causes and consequences of the tremor of quakes and suggests
suitable recommendations for its revival. The specified objectives have been fulfilled by the utilization of maps
of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Google images. Necessary maps, diagrams and tables have
been prepared for exposition of these problems.
Keywords: Objectives, Causes of earthquake, consequences and Recommendations.
I. Introduction
Earthquake is a violent tremor in the earth crust, sending out a series of shock and aftershock waves (L
waves) in all direction from its focus. Earthquakes constitute one of the most terrible natural hazards which
often turn into disaster causing extensive devastation and loss of human lives and their properties. A deadly
earthquake shook Nepal and sent tremors through Indian subcontinent. On 25th April and 12th May 2015, Nepal
and its surrounding area were hit by earthquakes which are considered to be the most devastating in the living
memory of the inhabitants of these affected areas. The 7.9 magnitude quake was the strongest to hit Nepal for 81
years. It was the most horrible natural disaster to hit Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar border earthquake. The
quake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, which was followed by 97 aftershocks of magnitudes 3.0-6.9 on
Richter scale, caused heavy casualties in Kathmandu and injured thousand others. The earthquakes had its
epicentre at Lumjung, around 80 km north-west of Kathmandu. It had its impact in several areas in Nepal and
India. It was also felt in northern and north-eastern part of India, China, Tibet, Bangladesh and as far as
Pakistan. Continued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal and its adjacent area at 15–20 minutes intervals,
with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.9 on 26 April at 12:42 IST. It was a major earthquake similar in
intensity to the 1934 Munghyr and the 2001 Gujarat Earthquakes.
A second major earthquake occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:35 IST with a magnitude of 7.3 on Richter
scale. The epicentre was near the China border between Kathmandu and Mt. Everest, at Kodari around 113 kms
east of Kathmandu. It struck at the depth of 18.5 km. This earthquake occurred along the same fault as the
original earthquake of 25 April 2015. As such, it is considered to be an aftershock of the 25 April
quake. Tremors were also felt in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and other North-east Indian States.
II. Problems
On the basis of investigation it has been found that the earthquake and its effects are major problem in
study area. In study area, the region of convergence of Indian plate and Eurasian plate is more vulnerable to
earthquakes. The problem under study is to assess the nature of earthquakes and to determine specifically the
extent of this type of disaster, in details through data generated from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
and Geological Survey of India. The other main problem is to construct unscientific and non-seismically
engineered multi storied buildings which had easily collapsed by the tremor, disrupting civic life in Nepal. This
research work will deal particularly with one of the current issues of consequence of earthquakes as well as
different problem of human beings related with massive damages.
III. Study Area
The Nepal and some districts of north India along the India-Nepal border have been selected for this
study. The study area is bounded by 21°33´07.04´´ N to 30°21´02.53´´ N Latitudes and 77°06´33.77´´ E to
95°56´31.16´´ E Longitude in Nepal and the states of India, namely West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam
and Sikkim (Figure 1). This area represents a zone of transition between the Kunlun range of China and the

peninsular plateau of India, and displays the typical characteristics of the Himalayan range and its foothills. It is
covering an area of 6, 56,558 sq. km.
Figure: 1. Study area.
IV. Methodology
This research work is based on the empirical study of consequences of earthquakes. A systematic
methodological principle was followed in this study work. The whole work can be represented into three broad
categories which are noted below4.1 Pre field study
At the beginning intensive literature review from related books, journals, articles, government
publication, etc. has been done to specify the research problem and selecting the study area and topic of this
research work.
4.2 Field study
The spatial information collected from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Geological
Survey of India was also taken into consideration. Primary and secondary data has been obtained through
internet and current News Papers. Photographic records of the related features have also been collected from
different sources.
4.3 Post field study
The study of empirical observation has been done very carefully through measurement and analysis
process to know the causes and consequences of quakes. Data and other information available and generated on
the field were compiled using appropriate modern techniques on computer and satellite images, atlas and
different maps. The collected data have been quantified, analyzed and synthesized by using standard statistical
and cartographic methods.
V. Objectives
Severe, precise and rational objectives have been chosen for the scientific study of the above mentioned problem
of the study area, which are noted below:-
1. To highlight the problem of earthquakes in Nepal and its adjacent area.
2. To examine the nature and extent of this.
A Devastating Disaster: A Case Study of Nepal Earthquake and Its Impact on Human Beings
DOI: 10.9790/0837-20752834 www.iosrjournals.org 30 | Page
3. To emphasize the causes and consequences of the tremor of recent quakes.
4. To suggest suitable prevention measures.
VI. Literature Review
After independence some famous scientists and geographers published too many research papers on the
nature and mapping of the Earthquake hazards. Hemmady, A.K.R. published a classic book –„Earthquakes‟
(1996), Bolt, B.A. published „Earthquakes‟ (1993). Another popular article was published by Dakshinaranjan
Nandy (2007) „Mapping Earthquake Hazards‟. About Earthquake hazard predictable, the authentic article was
published in 2007, popularly known as „Observation of pre-seismic signals through Geochemical Monitoring‟
by the senior Scientist and research scholar of Department of Science and Technology and Department of
Atomic Energy, Hirok Chaudhuri, Nisits K. Das, Rakesh K. Bhandari, Debasis Ghose, Prasanta Sen and Bikash
Sinha. Other well-known books are „Earthquake: Forecasting and Mitigation‟ (2004) of H.N. Srivastava;
“Earthquake Prediction” (1975) of F. Press and „Earthquake Prediction Techniques‟ (1982) of Asada, T.
VII. Causes Of Earthquake
Earthquake of Nepal and India along the Himalayan belt were caused mainly due to collision of Indian
plate and Eurasian plate. Deep focus and high magnitudes of earthquakes are caused along the convergent plate
boundaries because of collision of two convergent plates, namely Eurasian and Indian convergent plates. The
subduction of Indian plate below Eurasian plate caused Nepal earthquake at the belt of Himalaya. April 25 and
May 12, 2015 earthquakes had occurred on the northern boundary of the Indian plate which is under thrusting
the Eurasian plate. The main cause of Nepal earthquakes is attributed to the northward movement of Indian
plate. The Indian plate is moving toward north- northeast ward direction at an average rate of about 4.5-5 cm per
annum, which causes a stress. On 25th April 2015, the stress built up as the Indian and Eurasian plates slide
under one other causing earthquake. The epicentre of these two earthquakes has lay on the boundary of these
two plates. The earth quake was caused at the depth of 10 kilometres. The 188 aftershocks measuring around
3.0-6.9 magnitudes in Richter scale were at the depths of 10-50 kilometres. After the major earthquake, the
earth‟s plates lost their equilibrium. The aftershocks are basically nature‟s way to help earth get back its
equilibrium.
VIII. Consequences Of Earthquakes
The hazardous effect of Nepal earthquakes depends not only on their magnitude of Richter scale or
intensity alone, but also on so many factors, such as geology of the earth crust (lithology, elasticity, soil
condition, permissible stress, rock structure, etc.), design of buildings, quality of construction, population
pressure, etc. Several villages, towns, human constructions and their properties, lives were completely damaged.
The urban area of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, was completely destroyed by April earthquake which hit
Nepal. Several buildings collapsed like a pack of cards as if they were mud huts.

 Figure: 2. Affected area of Nepal earthquake.
Several buildings, most of them old, collapsed in the densely populated Kathmandu valley.
Kathmandu‟s Darbar square, a UNESCO world heritage site, was totally damaged in the quake. Harsh damage
took place to the parts of the palace complex in Vasanthapura Square. The site of palaces and temples of the city
were warren of narrow lanes and historic structure. Kathmandu residents ran onto the streets and other open
spaces, throwing up clouds of dust and wide creaks opened on paved streets and the building‟s wall.

Earthquakes are often followed by landslides and rock avalanches and glacier avalanches in Himalayan
hilly areas. The quake caused avalanches on Mount Everest, making the climbers running for cover and killing
at least 18 people at the start of the main climbing season. At least 1000 climbers had been at the base camp of
the Everest when the earthquake struck. The base camp had been severely damaged and the teams were trapped.

Because of poor phone network coverage the government of India and Nepal were struggling to assess the
damage on the Everest.
At Langtang valley in Rasuwa district, a major tourist destination in Nepal, also famous for trekking, it
is said that over 100 people were killed and 120 people were injured or missing following the massive
avalanche which swept away the entire village in the wake of the powerful quake that hit Rasuwa district. . Over
329 people were reported missing after an avalanche struck Ghodatabela and the Langtang villages. The
avalanche was estimated to be 3 kilometres wide.
Continuous aftershocks caused a landslide on the Koshi Highway which blocked the section of the road
between Bhedetar and Mulghat. Many smaller landslides occurred in the Trishuli River Valley with reports of
significant damage at Mailung, Simle, and Archale areas. As a result of landslide the transport system mainly
highways was completely damaged or blocked, which may stop various activities needed for earthquake relief
and rescue. Landslides also blocked the river channels, sewage and other communication system in Nepal and
now in India specially in Darjeeling district.
Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh were the worst affected parts of India. The tremors were felt the
strongest in the districts along the Indo-Nepal border, which lie in the seismic zone V (very high seismic zone).
Mud wall, buildings and boundary walls in different locations of Siliguri and Jalpaiguri had collapsed because
of the tremors. At least 52 people were killed and 237 were injured in India in a powerful earthquake, with
epicentre in Nepal, which destroyed or damaged several houses and buildings in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West
Bengal and surrounding area. According to Union Home Ministry, 38 people died in Bihar, 11 in Uttar Pradesh
and 3 in West Bengal, where 43 school children were injured. The majority of the deaths were reported from the
northern districts bordering Nepal. According to Bihar Disaster Management Department report, 8 people died
in East Champaran district, 6 in Sitamarchi and other 24 death had been reported from Darbhanga, Supual,
Saran, Lakhisarai, Madhubani, West Champaran, Araria and Sheohar districts. Huge damage was caused to the
property and the lives of the people in north India.

At least 117 people died in Nepal and 17 people in India as a result of the earthquake of 12 May and
about 2,500 people were injured. This earthquake created cracks on a pillar on the top floor of „Writers‟
Buildings and a pillar inside the Shaheed Minar in Kolkata. At Colleges of North Bengal University, over 1100
students had to write their examination paper on college ground after the second quake.
A number of old temples, pagodas and churches in the Kathmandu valley were razed. Several temples
including Manakamana Temple at Gorkha, Janaki Mandir at Janakpur; Kasthamandap, Panchtale temple,
Basantapur Durbar, the Dasa Avtar temple and the Shiva Parvati temple were demolished. The Kumari Temple
and the Taleju Bhawani Temple partially collapsed. Some portion of the Jaya Bageshwari Temple at Gaushala,
Pashupatinath Temple, Swyambhunath, Boudhanath Stupa, Ratna Mandir and Rani Pokhari had been destroyed.
The Char Narayan Mandir, the statue of Yog Narendra Malla, the Taleju Temple, the Hari Shankar, Uma
Maheshwar Temple and the Machhindranath Temple in Bungamati were destroyed. In Tripureshwar, the Kal
Mochan Ghat, a temple inspired by Mughal architecture, was completely destroyed and the nearby Tripura
Sundari also suffered significant damage. In Bhaktapur, several monuments and Temples were totally destroyed.
The poor communities of Nepal were most affected, who lost their houses and properties. The key reason for the
very high Nepalese casualties was the construction of non-seismically engineered buildings.
The U.S. Geological Survey initially estimated economic losses from this quake at 9 percent to 50
percent of gross domestic product, with an estimate of 35 percent.

IX. Rccomendations
1. During earthquake, you should run towards safe place like an open area away from buildings, electricity
wires, flammable inputs, etc.
2. If you are in a moving car during earthquake, you should stop the car as quickly as possible.
3. If you are staying indoors, you should take shelter under a heavy and hard furniture namely desk, table,
bench, etc.
4. You should not run through or near the buildings; always stay in open space until the tremor stop.
5. You should construct seismically engineered (earthquake resistant design) buildings or light weight
buildings with lighter roofs in highly earthquake prone areas.
X. Findings
From the above comprehensive study I have assembled several important aspects, which are noted below1. Loss of many human and cattle lives.
2. Damage and destruction of many human constructions, namely buildings, roads or highways, bridges,
temples, UNESCO world heritage sites, towns and villages.
3. Earthquake creates landslides which may block the highways, river channels, etc.
4. Earthquake crates different types of avalanches which may kill hundreds of climbers, trekkers and Nepali
guides at the Everest base camp in Nepal.
5. Earthquakes and continuous aftershocks destroyed the civil structures killing thousands of people and
injured over twenty-two thousand people in Nepal and northern India.
XI. Conclusions
An earthquake cannot be prevented or accurately predicted, but there are some forewarning sign of a
coming tremor, and there are various system being developed and in use to reduce the damage from this
disaster. However, no perfect techniques have been developed to predict the tremor till date. Making exact
prediction about the occurrence of a tremor in an area and time is still a tricky proposition. The seismologists are
more and more concentrating on the aspect of earthquake forecasting. When we would be able to predict of
earthquakes accurately on the basis of animal behavior or other unusual phenomena, it would save many lives
and property damages.

 Temporary settlement of displaced
 Challenge to Challenge to manage the space for rubbles rubbles
CHALLENGES – AT FIELD / OPERATION
LEVEL (IMMEDIATE ACTION)
 Selection of appropriate caring of children with
good faith who lost their parents and

 Challenges for immediate repair of rural roads
and for immediate transportation
 Collection of integrated field information and
dissemination
 Lack of office space for the government
operations f as significant number f o
government buildings were damaged /
dt d es royed
CHALLENGES – AT POLICY AND PRACTICE
 Lack of policy, technology, tools and equipment, and
skills to dismantle the damaged structures.
 Challenges to restoration and conservation of cultural
and religious heritages.
 The earthquakes will end up pushing an additional 2.5
to 3.5 percent Nepalese into poverty in 2015-2016 which
t l t i t t l t 700 000 dditi l (PDNA) translates into at least 700,000 additional poor(PDNA)
 The nation will require substantial external assistance
to meet the rehabilitation and reconstruction (NPR 669
billion or US$ 6.7 billion ).
LESSONS LEARNT AND AREAS FOR FUTURE
DIRECTION
 Need of new Disaster Management Act to address the
present h ll c a enges.
 Perfect implementation of building codes. Strictly
monit h i i d d itor mechanism is needed.
 Strengthen the capacity of National Search and
Rescue Team specially focusing for Security forces.
 Assured international supports in Search and Rescue
relief and recovery.
LESSONS LEARNING AND …
 Need of Helipads in Rural Areas, Provision of Helipads
i h C in each VDC
 Emergency warehouse and adequate stockpiling of
appropriate supplies and equipment
 One window system is very imp. in Rescue and Relief
to distribute food and nonfood items in remote areas
and to the backward and deprive people.
 Establishment of call centres in each Village and need
of GIS b d i t t d i f ti t f GIS based integrated information system
 Finally,Recovery should follow a community based
app g roach which encourages communities, utilization
of social networks, and built self reliance efforts using
local skills and Knowledge. It will largely be an owner
driven recovery p g ro ramme

 Adopt BBB (build back better) principle.
 Owner driven and self reliant effort for
reconstruction in private housing for optimum
utilisation of local resources, skills labour skills, labour
 An effective institutional set up in community
level and capacity building of local people
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE DISASTER
TIME: BELIEFS, SOCIAL HARMONY HARMONY AND
COMMITMENT
 Saturday is a off day in Nepal. Therefore, schools
across Nepal were closed on 25 April. The death
toll of young people could have been much higher
considering that nearly 7,000 schools were
comp y g y g y, letely or significantly damaged. Similarly, if
the earthquake had struck at night, and not in
the middle of the day, there would certainly have
b li been greater casualties.
 Lifelines were remarkably not affected during the
earth k qua e.
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE
DISASTER…
 Th fi t ti f th C t l Di t R li f The first meeting of the Central Disaster Relief
Committee (CDRC) was held immediately after the
first earthquake, with the National Emergency
Operation Centre (NEOC) providing an initial report
to the CDRC recommending a focus on Search and
Rescue ( ), SAR and Disaster Relief Fund was
immediately allocated, and the government’s Cluster
mechanisms, comprising 11 sectors, were instantly
activated.
 The network of NGOs and INGOs based in Nepal
swiftly rallied to support community rescue and relief
eff t S l l t i ll f th fforts. Several volunteer groups, especially of youth
and professionals like doctors and engineers were
active in treating the wounded, setting up temporary
sh l l i f d d di i l d helters, supplying food and attending to vital needs.
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE
DISASTER…
 Strong political will and continuous dialogue with
the affected people are the most important
aspects
 Self reliant and motivated urban youth were
active for rescue and relief activities.
 Social harmony has become great example. Theft
and robbery did not occur.
POSITIVE ASPECTS IN RECOVERY STAGE
 Post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) is
prepared on time.
 International Conference on Nepal's
Reconstruction was held with commitment of
their contribution
 Esa s e t blishment of Naoa ti n l Reco s c o n truction

Materials and Methods
GPS processing
We processed 5-Hz continuous GPS data from six stations in Nepal (Figure 1) at
distances of 60 to 230 km from the epicenter for the day of the mainshock (April 25).
Final GPS satellite orbits, Earth Rotation Parameters (ERPs) and 0.2 Hz GPS satellite
clocks from CODE (Center for Orbit Determination in Europe,
ftp://ftp.unibe.ch/aiub/CODE/2015/) were fixed to estimate 30 s fractional-cycle biases
(FCBs) with a reference network of 43 stations located over 1000 km from Nepal. We
then fixed the orbits, clocks and ERPs from the network solution to enable precise point
positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR)(35) stations to estimate epoch-wise
positions, zenith troposphere delay (ZTD) parameters, receiver clocks and phase
ambiguities for all seven high-rate stations. All position estimates are with respect to the
International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) positions and are not contaminated
by any displaced reference stations. No constraints between epochs are applied to the
positions, while ZTDs are estimated as random walk parameters with a power density of
0.001 mm/s1/2. All eligible ambiguities were resolved successfully and at least six
ambiguities are fixed at each epoch. Solid Earth tides, ocean tide loading and pole tide
are applied and antenna phase center variations are used. According to the scatter of 10
minutes of pre-event positions, the position precision (one-sigma) is about 5 mm for the
horizontal and 10 mm for the vertical components for all stations.
InSAR processing
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from the Japanese
Aerospace Agency (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) were
processed using GMTSAR (36) and unwrapped using SNAPHU (37). Images were
acquired over the epicentral area on February 22 and May 3 (Descending Path 48). The
perpendicular baseline was 56 m; this value is sufficiently small that errors in the SRTM1 dataset used to remove the topographic phase do not contribute significantly to the
residual. The data were acquired in Wide Swath (ScanSAR) mode which enables a swath
width of 350 km, but requires precise burst alignment during operation of the satellite.
ScanSAR interferometry was successfully employed for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake
(38) using manually aligned bursts, but ALOS-2 is the first L-band satellite to acquire
burst-aligned ScanSAR imagery as a standard operating mode. We processed the Level
1.1 single-look-complex (SLC) imagery for each of the five sub-swaths using GMTSAR,
which includes a 5-parameter alignment of the slave image to the master based on crosscorrelation, and applied a 500m Gaussian lowpass filter to improve coherence. The
resulting interferograms have phase that matches at the sub-swath boundaries despite
being independently processed. We unwrapped each sub-swath using SNAPHU and then
combined the sub-swaths into a single image by adding a multiple of 2π to ensure
matching phase at the boundaries. The final result contains a linear ramp related to orbital
error, which we removed using the best-fitting plane to data outside the deforming
region. Finally we subsampled the data using the quad tree technique (39) and a total of
2230 InSAR LOS points contributed to the joint inversion.
3
Kinematic slip inversion
We used the main nodal plane from the USGS W-phase moment tensor solution
with a strike of 295° and dip of 11° to define the faulting surface (6). The assumed fault
was discretized into 300 10x10 km subfaults. Elastodynamic Green’s functions at the 5
Hz GPS sample rate were computed for every subfault/station pair using the frequency
wavenumber integration technique of Zhu and Rivera (40). Since velocity data are more
sensitive to rupture kinematics (23) we differentiated the GPS displacement time series to
velocity and low-pass filtered them with a 4 pole Butterworth filter with corner frequency
at 1 Hz. It is important to note that differentiation of the GPS data would not be effective
at lower sampling rates such as 1 Hz. Joint inversion of the velocity waveforms, GPS
static offsets and InSAR LOS static offsets was carried out using the multi-time window
method with three-knot splines (isosceles triangles) as basis functions (Ide et al. 1996).
The accelerometric record from KATNP was not included in the inversion because it has
no absolute timing. The inversion is carried out using non-negative least squares and the
rake is constrained to values between 45 and 135. In order to model the complexity of the
subfault source time functions, we allowed slip on twenty 50% overlapping triangles with
1 s rise time. With this parametrization each subfault was allowed to slip for a total of 10
s. Spatial regularization was achieved though minimum norm smoothing; constraints
were placed on the L2 norm of the model parameter vector. Temporal smoothing on the
time windows was achieved with a simple first-order forward finite difference stencil.
The optimal level of spatial and temporal smoothing was determined through Akaike’s
Bayesian Information Criterion (41).
The GPS velocity waveforms and InSAR LOS and GPS static offsets were weighted
equally by dividing each data set by the norm of the vector containing the observations.
We assumed the NEIC reported hypocentral location and time (28.147°N 84.708°E;
2015-04-25 06:11:26.270 UTC). Maximum rupture speed was constrained through trial
and error (Figure S4); we find that 3.3 km/s yields the best fit to the data (Figure S4).
This does not mean that slower rupture speeds are not possible; in this case early time
windows will simply have little or no slip. However, rupture at earlier times than the time
it would take a rupture front propagating outward from the hypocenter at 3.3 km/s was
not allowed. To avoid a possible bias in the determination of the source due to
amplification by site effects, we cropped the waveform at station NAST to include only
the main pulse and we down weighted the horizontal components which are most
affected by site effects (Figure 4).
The stress drop from the resulting slip model was estimated by computing internal
strains on the fault (42) assuming a half space with a rigidity of 32 GPa; this corresponds
to the rigidity of the layer where most of the slip occurs.
Temporal resolution and inversion calibration
There are three important questions with regards to the inversion setup which affect
our conclusions: 1) Whether the observed data can be explained by variability in other
aspects of the source kinematics, 2) Whether the inversion parametrization into 20 50%
overlapping splines (triangles) is adequate in discerning the potential slip-rate time
functions (STFs) at the individual subfaults and 3) Whether the station geometry is
adequate for assessing the characteristics of the STFs, i.e., whether STF resolution is
equal on all parts of the fault model.
4
To investigate these questions we produced an ensemble of 25 synthetic scenario
ruptures. The background slip distribution for all the synthetic models is the same. It is
obtained from the inversion of just the static data (InSAR+GPS) and the result is shown
in Figure S9. We then turned this static model into a kinematic one by letting rupture
propagate from the hypocenter at 5 different rupture speeds, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6
km/s. For each rupture speed we also used regularized Yoffe STF with a rise time of 2, 4,
6, 8 and 10s. We assumed that acceleration time to peak slip rate, τs is always 25% of the
rise time. We have thus a total of 25 scenario events, all with the same total slip but
varying in rupture speed and STF rise time. For each synthetic test case we modeled the 5
Hz velocity waveforms at the locations of the GPS stations.
Before analyzing the synthetic models further insight into the likelihood that the
vertical velocity pulse at KKN4 reflects the rise time of the slip function beneath the site
can be gleaned by rotating the seismograms for that site into fault parallel and fault
normal directions (Figure S8). Since the station is only 13 km away from the source it is
to be expected that the ground motions are dominated by intermediate field terms in the
elastodynamic solution. As such, the time taken for the displacements to grow to the final
static offset are directly related to the local rise time. Although the waveforms also
include the contributions of surface waves, it is clear from the waveforms that the
duration of the vertical velocity pulse correlates well with the static field growth.
As noted, a key assumption of this study is that the pulse observed on the vertical
velocity waveform at the bedrock site KKN4 reflects a propagating slip pulse with long
rise time. Figure S9 shows the predicted vertical waveforms at this station for the 25
scenario events. The comparison between the observed data (black trace) and the
synthetics suggests that this assumption is reasonable. Shorter STFs should produce
appreciably higher amounts of high frequency energy that are conspicuously absent in the
observed data, and although the rupture speed has some effect on the synthetics it does
not greatly alter the shape or duration of the main pulse.
To assess whether the temporal parametrization in the inversion is suitable, we add
realistic noise to the synthetic time series for the scenario events and then invert them
with the 20 triangle parametrization. We measure the standard deviation of 60 s of preevent noise at each site and use that to add white Gaussian noise to the time series. We
then invert only the synthetic velocity data (disregarding the InSAR and displacement
data) in an effort to determine if we can recover the subfault STF. We perform the
inversions at 6 different levels of temporal smoothness with the values of the
regularization parameter logarithmically spaced between 10-4 and 101
. An example of the
along strike STFs for different levels of smoothing is shown in Figure S10. The figure
shows that although recovery of the STFs is not perfect, the total duration (the rise time)
of each STF is well constrained. The plot also shows no significant along-strike bias. It
also shows that a temporal smoothing value of 0.01-0.1 is suitable and that the effect of
over smoothing (Figure 10C) is to produce artificially long STFs. This is easily
understood as due to late occurring small amplitude triangles, which are used by the
inversion in an attempt to fit the noise. If the smoothing is too strong the STFs will try to
encompass these artifacts and the resulting STFs are artificially long.
We further test whether the inversion parametrization is sufficient to discern
between STFs of different rise times. Figure S11 shows the STFs inverted for the same
along-strike profile for a rupture velocity of 3.2 km/s and a smoothing value of 0.1 for 4
5
models with different rise-times at 4, 6, 8 and 10 s. Again, recovery of the STFs is not
perfect, but in general for the rise times tested the parametrization is sufficient to
determine the rise times of the individual subfaults.
Thus, the observations at station KKN4 of the pulse in the vertical velocity
waveform, and the obvious absence of high frequency strong shaking along with the
synthetic tests suggest that the event indeed can be characterized by a propagating slip
pulse with a long rise time. Furthermore, the sensitivity tests indicate that while the
shapes of the individual STFs at each subfault are affected by noise, the total duration, or
rise time, of each STF is well constrained by the available network of observing stations.
Aftershocks
The Department of Mines and Geology (DMG), Nepal, operates, in collaboration
with the Departement Analyse Surveillance Environnement (DASE), France, a
nationwide seismic network consisting primarily of 21 vertical component short period
sensors (ZM500) (43). We used the seismicity catalogue of events with local magnitude
ML larger than 4.0 produced by the DMG from the mainshock on April 25 to May 19,
2015, available at www.seismonepal.gov.np. See Pandey et al. (43) and Rajaure et al.
(44) for details of the network and routine location procedure.

Synthetic tests comparing the imposed regularized Yoffe slip-rate time functions (STF)
(Black line) with the displacement predicted at station KKN4. We considered two STFs
with short and long onset times. The STF is somewhat smoothed after propagation from
the source to station KKN4 through the layered media(44), but the smoothing can explain
neither the long pulse duration observed in Figure 3 nor the smooth onset. These tests
suggest that the surficial observation at the Kathmandu sites reflects well the STF on the
fault. The amplitude of surface vertical displacement is about one third of the slip on the
fault and the surface velocity is about 60% of the slip velocity.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report
DRR sitrep 2015‐002 – June 2, 2015
This disaster risk reduction situation report explains the drivers of disaster risks in Nepal and draws
attention to the efforts that have been undertaken to reduce these risks. A key overview of the
background of historical disasters, the calculated risks and the on‐going work on disaster risk
reduction in Nepal are summarized in a previous Preventionweb DRR situation report for Nepal:
http://preventionweb.net/go/44170  
1. Drivers of Disaster Risks in Nepal  
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 and caused massive destruction. The main
quake was followed by numerous aftershocks of magnitude 5 or higher causing further damage and
losses. At the moment, there is little information about the factors that contributed to the growth of
disaster risks in Nepal. Disaster risk, which is the likelihood of the loss of life, injury or destruction
and damage from a disaster in a given period of time, is influenced by the hazard itself, the exposure
of people, property and livelihoods to these hazards, and their susceptibility to the damaging effects
of hazards. Changes in any of these components will either increase or decrease the risks, and when
a disaster strikes they will determine the size of its impacts. This DRR situation report covers the
hazard, exposure and vulnerability that combined to make the earthquake in Nepal so deadly.

1.1) Hazards
Nepal’s landscape, which is predominantly composed of hills and steep mountains combined with
fragile geological formations and heavy monsoon rainfall, leads to wide range of geological and
hydro‐meteorological hazards affecting the country.  In addition, Nepal’s geological characteristics
together with torrential rain during rainy season often result in landslides, debris flows, and floods.  
Statistics from the EM‐DAT show that floods are most frequent hazard, with 50 events reported
from 1900 to 2014. Landslides follow this, with 23 events reported in the same period, then
epidemics, with 17 events. There have been 6 earthquake events registered in the EM‐DAT
database. A study published in April 2015 reported1 that despite the availability of new data and
methodological improvements, the available earthquake hazard map showing the probability of
tremors happening across Nepal is about 20 years old. The study goes on to recommend that an
update to the seismic hazard map is “imperative” as this will be important for policies on building
regulations, insurance, and emergency preparedness.  
1.2) Exposure
Besides the high incidence of hazards in Nepal, there is also a high degree of exposure to these
hazards. The earthquake was focused in the Janakpur Zone of Nepal, which has a population of
2,222,000. There were approximately 5.6 million people within a radius of 100 km, 4.1 million within
75 km and 1.4 million within 50km radius of the epicenter.    This means that a large number of
people were exposed to a high degree of ground shaking.
Out of the country's 23 million population2
, 86 percent lives in rural areas, and 82 percent of the
economically active population works in agriculture, fishing, or forestry. Nepal’s population marked

an increase of 5 million between the 1991 and the 2001 census with an average annual growth rate
of 2.3 percent.  
According to the World Bank3
, the Kathmandu Valley has a population of 2.5 million people and a
population density of about 13,000 people per square kilometers. It is also growing at 4 percent per
year, making it one of the fastest‐growing metropolitan areas in South Asia, and the first region in
Nepal to face rapid urbanization at a metropolitan scale. Figure 1 shows the shake map of the
Gorkha earthquake and the population density. Figure 2 shows the exposed population compared
with the shaking intensity as generated by the Gorkha earthquake.
Kathmandu, followed by Dhanusa, Siraha has the highest percentage of people categorized as being
in the productive age group (15‐59 years old) who are exposed to hazards. There are also a high
proportion of children exposed to the same hazards. In addition to the exposure of people, the
earthquake also affected assets4
. For a 100‐year return period, on average 35 percent of permanent
houses in Nepalese districts were exposed to a very high hazard earthquake zone. Baitadi, Darchula,
Kathmandu, Baglung, Doti were the five districts with the highest percentage of permanent houses
exposed to a very high hazard zone. Other critical infrastructure such as education, health and
transportation were also highly exposed to hazards. For example, 84.8 percent of schools in the
districts of Nepal were in located in hazard prone areas5
. The most exposed schools were found in
Bara, Parsa, Kanchanpur, Illam and Rautahat; these schools were located in the most earthquake
prone areas. For hospitals, 20 districts have 100 percent health post exposure to high hazard zone
areas and another 19 districts have health post exposure to moderate hazard zone areas. Similarly it
has been shown that in more than 20 districts roads were located in hazard prone areas and in 15

districts 100 percent of the roads were located in earthquake prone areas. This increased the overall
exposure of Nepal to the disaster.
1.3) Vulnerability
Another factor that contributes to disaster risks is vulnerability, which is the susceptibility of people,
properties and livelihoods to the damaging effects of the hazard. Historical damage and loss data
provides insights on the vulnerability of people and assets in Nepal. For example, Figure 3 shows
that a large proportion of destructive disasters in Nepal are small‐scale disasters, averaging more
than 90% of all disasters, which cause more death; affects more people; destroy more houses; and
cause more economic damages, as compared to large but infrequent disasters.    This shows that
there is very high vulnerability of both people and assets in Nepal. The Pacific Disasters Center ranks
Nepal as 37 out of 172 countries in its disaster vulnerability index as shown in Figure 4.
Some experts6 noted that Kathmandu was vulnerable to earthquakes due to its high population
density, unplanned development practices, unsafe construction, lack of urban planning, high
incidence of poverty, and high inequality in terms of access to public services. In addition, others7
view the vulnerability of people to hazards such as drought and other adverse weather conditions as
depending on their socio‐economic status. Poor and socially excluded groups will be less able to
absorb shocks than well‐positioned and better‐off households.

A 2007 World Food Programme household survey8 found that the Far‐  and Mid‐West regions in
Nepal are generally considered as the poorest parts of the country, which would indicate high
vulnerability to hazards. The survey showed that in almost 94 percent of the households, drought,
hailstorms, unemployment, illness, landslides and death of a family member created food shortage.
In addition, it revealed that in drought‐affected areas, average household food grain stocks would
deplete six times faster than in non‐drought‐affected areas. This means that hazards directly
affected the well‐being of populations, which made the same populations more vulnerable to future
disasters and increased the change of a hazard becoming a disaster.
The existing stock of Nepal’s infrastructure is also vulnerable to hazards. For example, a survey of
close to 1,000 building structures in the year 2000 by JICA under the Study on Earthquake Disaster
Mitigation of Kathmandu Valley (SEDM) project found that in Kathmandu valley, owners construct
most of the buildings themselves both in the rural and urban areas. Although there are significant
increases in the suburban area of the number of buildings constructed by contractors, majority of
the existing housing are owner‐built. This is shown in Figure 5.
In 2008, Amod Dixit of the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) reported9 that:  
“combining building construction process as well as the mode of transmission of the construction, it can be
found out that less than 10 percent of the buildings are engineered which is constructed by engineers, and
over 90 percent are non-engineered, by craftsmen or local masons. In terms of pre-construction investment
on the other hand, [little] investment has been done to majority craftsmen whereas there are a lot of
training and fostering process for engineers and even for sub engineers. That is, practically, there is no
investment for production of qualified construction workers in Nepal. Therefore, thinking about key
stakeholders in housing construction in Nepal, whereas there are clients (owners), consultant which in
charge of design as well as construction supervision, contractor of builders, masons, owner builders, and
material suppliers, craftsman or craftsmen play(s) crucial roles in non-engineered construction.”

2) Efforts to Reduce Disaster Impacts  
Although the real impact of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal will not be fully known before the post‐ 
disaster needs assessment (PDNA), estimates are already being made about the potential impact.
The speculation on the impact of the disaster is mostly based on the country’s vulnerability to the
earthquake.
2.1) Effects on the People
As of 18 May 2015, the reported death toll was10 8,604 and the total number of injured,16,808. A
2002 study by JICA outlines a possible disaster scenario for an earthquake striking in central Nepal.
JICA estimated a possible death toll of 18,000 mostly from house collapses, with the estimated
number of people injured around 147,000 due to building collapse and falling objects.  
One reason for this difference is that
this earthquake is not the worst case
for the capital, Kathmandu. If for
example there was a repeat of the
1934 great Bihar‐Nepal earthquake
today, the predictions above may
actually exceed the impact of the
earthquake, as noted in an analysis
by Geohazards International (GHI) in
199911.  
Since 2009, the Nepal Risk Reduction
Consortium (NRRC) have been
training close to 2,000 masons and
have provided technical training in
seismic resilience for Engineers and
specialists. In addition, the NRRC has
assisted the government building
code compliance strategy, including supporting the digitization of the permit approval process and
GIS mapping of all buildings in Kathmandu Valley. These together with other measures to improve
disaster preparedness and response capacity of various stakeholders most likely also contributed to
the reduced mortality in this disaster. Photo 1 shows female masons training conducted by
Kathmandu Metropolitan City.
  
2.2) Effects on the Economy
The Finance Ministry of Nepal has reported that country suffered a loss of up to US$10 billion due to
the earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks. This represents up to half of the country’s US$ 20
billion GDP. Chairing a meeting of donor agencies, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said that the
preliminary estimated cost for the reconstruction of the quake‐ravaged country is US$5 billion and
works have been started by setting up a fund of US$2 billion for the time being.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report   Page 7
This article12 reports that based on historical earthquakes in and around Nepal and then using the
change in values of buildings and intensities seen in the 2015 earthquake the loss is expected to be
around US$3 billion to US$3.5 billion and around a US$5 billion to US$5.5 billion replacement cost.
These costs do not yet include the cost of building back better structures.
Additional indirect losses to the tourism industry and the value of cultural structures are yet to be
calculated. Tourism accounts for about 8 percent of the total economy, and there are calculations
that the Gorkha earthquake may cost around US$1.5 billion per year in indirect losses to Nepal due
to loss in tourism.
Also, insurers will only cover a fraction of losses, despite the massive direct economic losses.
According to the Insurance Information Institute, less than US$3.50 is spent per capita annually in
Nepal on property and casualty insurance, versus the nearly US$2,300 spent each year in the U.S.
Nepal’s insurers collected premiums of about US$277 million in 2013, with most of those funds for
life coverage. Insurance is one means to reduce the economic vulnerability to a disaster. Opinions13
have been written on why this option may be considered in the future to reduce the vulnerability of
Nepal’s economy to future risks. Considering the country’s current social and economic structure,
micro‐credit can catalyze the local economy and make needed produce more readily available
locally.  
In addition, 2.2 million Nepalese who work overseas sent remittances that are equivalent to more
than 25% of Nepal’s GDP in 2014, and these represent close to double the value of export of goods
and services of Nepal. The World Bank in a 2009 study14 found a link between remittances and
disasters, where it noted that “migrant remittance flows increase in the aftermath of natural
disasters, macroeconomic or financial crises, and act as a safety net for households that have
migrants abroad.” There is scope for remittances to help economic recovery if it is also invested in
education or in business development and used not just as a household safety net for daily family
expenses, which at present is reported to take up close to 80% of remittances.15 Figure 6 shows that
the personal remittances received as a percent of national GDP in Nepal is second largest in the
world just behind those for Kyrgyz Republic.

2.3) Effects on Infrastructure and cultural heritage
According to the Department of Education, 14,500 classrooms were destroyed in the  earthquake.
Since the catastrophe took place on a Saturday instead of a school day, this avoided thousands of
deaths among schoolchildren. National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) reports that out of
35,000 public and private schools, only 350 to 400 have been retrofitted. ADB also reports16 that 160
public school buildings survived the earthquake in Kathmandu Valley because they were part of a
school safety program, which includes retrofitting.
The Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium in its progress review in 201317 notes that an action plan is in
place for the assessment of 1,800 school buildings in the Kathmandu Valley. In addition the
Consortium reports that 65 school buildings retrofitted to date and a plan in place for the retrofitting
an additional 260 school buildings. The re‐construction of 280 school buildings is also ongoing. Also,
156 masons have been reported trained so far out of 1,050 targeted under the programme. Out of
the 162 schools damaged from the Sikkim earthquake in September 2011, 70 school blocks
reconstructed, 31 retrofitted, and work have been initiated in 48 of the remaining 53 blocks to be
completed soon. Figure 7 shows the 4,500 schools and their location which are potentially affected
by the Gorkha earthquake.

25 April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction Situation Report   Page 9
It have been reported that 400 health posts, or community health centres were destroyed in the
2015 Gorkha earthquake, with an additional 300 damaged and three district hospitals which
collapsed. However, the World Health Organization reported18 that the 2015 Gorkha earthquake and
its aftershocks failed to disrupt the services at Kathmandu’s largest public hospitals, including
Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Patan Hospital, Civil Service Hospital, Birendra Army
Hospital and the trauma centre at Bir Hospital.  
These hospitals have been retrofitted for safety, which involves everything from repairing cracks in
walls to installing seismic belts and roof bracing, and has been a core part of preparedness plans.
The WHO further reported that these retrofitted hospitals went through a process of prioritization,
where emergency rooms, maternity wards, and operating theatres were some of the first areas
where retrofitting was applied. In addition it was also noted that the response to the earthquake by
health care providers was resilient because of pre‐planning and training initiatives under the WHO‐
supported Hospital Preparedness for Emergency Programme.  
Similar experiences have also been reported elsewhere. For example, it has been reported that the
Chhatrapati Free Clinic (CFC) in Kathmandu didn’t suffer damage in the recent earthquake, despite
the building being built back in 1962 and three floors were added in 1985. This was because three
years ago, the owner decided to retrofit the building costing him 40 per cent of constructing a new
building. As a result, the clinic was able to treat hundreds of people injured in the earthquake and
provided shelter to many who lost their homes. Figure 8 shows the 699 health clinics and their
location, which are potentially affected by the Gorkha earthquake.

It is important to take note that economic losses will be much less when a robust safe schools and
hospitals program is in place. Last but not least, much of the social life in communities takes place
around these vital structures, and when these remain intact, will help communities to quickly regain
pace in recovering and organizing themselves.
The earthquake damaged a
large number of cultural and
heritage sites in Nepal.
Outside of Kathmandu, a
number of such    sites and
structures survived the
earthquake and its
aftershocks, including the
Boudhanath and
Swayambunath.  
A crowd map19 as shown in
Figure 9 was developed by
ICCROM and shows
reported damages to
cultural heritage sites in
Nepal after the earthquake.
A report20 analysing the 141
entries in this crowd map
notes that 68 entries
mention sites that have collapsed completely. An additional 56 entries mention major structural
damage, which means that these sites are at particular risk as their situation could worsen with
another aftershock. The rest of the entries mention medium or minor damage to heritage, or they
refer to salvage, cleaning or protection efforts.
Within Kathmandu in Durbar Square, a large number of iconic sites and structures were destroyed,
though a few survived, including Taleju and Jannath temples, the Kumari House, and the
Pashupatinath Temple.  The list of destroyed cultural and historic structures been reported to have
been completely destroyed include Kasthamandap, Maju Dega    and Narayan Vishnu Temples,
Trailokya Mohan, Krishna (Chasin Dega), Dharahara (Bhimsen Tower), Hari Shankar, Jagan Narayan,
Fasidega Temple, and Vatsala Durga Temple.
Many temples and monuments that were restored in the recent past performed much better in this
earthquake, and also there were many historic structures that were resilient because of their design,
the type materials of used and the engineering of their construction. They performed well on past
earthquakes and again in this one. The Pashupatinath Temple, which withstood this earthquake, has
been renovated a number of times recently and by design is not very tall, and is made of brick as
opposed to mortar, with walls that are held together by a roof made of metal sheets.  
The above impacts provide an insight to some lessons learned in reducing risks to infrastructures ‐ 
retrofitting, good design and engineering, and use of good building materials all support resilient
infrastructures. Supporting with proper capacities of users and service providers ensure that these
infrastructures are operational after disasters.

3) Conclusions
To understand Nepal’s risk to disasters in the future, it is necessary to better understand the
underlying drivers of these risks. Given the fact that Nepal has a high level of frequent hazards,
exposure and vulnerability the country is still very much at risk for future disasters.  
Looking at the impact of the earthquake the report explains that the earthquake largely affected the
Nepalese economy, in terms of its infrastructure, tourism, cultural heritage, schools and hospitals.  
These will also be key areas in building back better after the disaster. There is a lot of scope to build
back better than before and to ensure that the risks are not rebuilt for future generations to suffer
from again.

A Devastating Disaster: A Case Study of Nepal Earthquake and
Its Impact on Human Beings
Sourav Dey
(Department of Geography, Thakur Panchanan Mahila Mahavidyalaya and Dewanhat Mahavidyalaya, India)
Abstract: Earthquake is one of the deadly natural disasters we have regularly experienced. Nepal and its
adjacent areas are vulnerable to very high magnitude of earthquake. The Himalayan belt, Bihar- Nepal border,
Assam and North Bengal especially Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts fall in this
seismic zone. On the basis of investigation it has been found that recent earthquakes had destructed many
human lives and their properties in Nepal and north India. The earthquake was considered to be the main cause
for avalanches, landslides, slumps, many creaks and fissures in the adjacent area of Nepal. The present study
endeavours to examine the nature, extent, causes and consequences of the tremor of quakes and suggests
suitable recommendations for its revival. The specified objectives have been fulfilled by the utilization of maps
of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Google images. Necessary maps, diagrams and tables have
been prepared for exposition of these problems.
Keywords: Objectives, Causes of earthquake, consequences and Recommendations.
I. Introduction
Earthquake is a violent tremor in the earth crust, sending out a series of shock and aftershock waves (L
waves) in all direction from its focus. Earthquakes constitute one of the most terrible natural hazards which
often turn into disaster causing extensive devastation and loss of human lives and their properties. A deadly
earthquake shook Nepal and sent tremors through Indian subcontinent. On 25th April and 12th May 2015, Nepal
and its surrounding area were hit by earthquakes which are considered to be the most devastating in the living
memory of the inhabitants of these affected areas. The 7.9 magnitude quake was the strongest to hit Nepal for 81
years. It was the most horrible natural disaster to hit Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar border earthquake. The
quake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale, which was followed by 97 aftershocks of magnitudes 3.0-6.9 on
Richter scale, caused heavy casualties in Kathmandu and injured thousand others. The earthquakes had its
epicentre at Lumjung, around 80 km north-west of Kathmandu. It had its impact in several areas in Nepal and
India. It was also felt in northern and north-eastern part of India, China, Tibet, Bangladesh and as far as
Pakistan. Continued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal and its adjacent area at 15–20 minutes intervals,
with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.9 on 26 April at 12:42 IST. It was a major earthquake similar in
intensity to the 1934 Munghyr and the 2001 Gujarat Earthquakes.
A second major earthquake occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:35 IST with a magnitude of 7.3 on Richter
scale. The epicentre was near the China border between Kathmandu and Mt. Everest, at Kodari around 113 kms
east of Kathmandu. It struck at the depth of 18.5 km. This earthquake occurred along the same fault as the
original earthquake of 25 April 2015. As such, it is considered to be an aftershock of the 25 April
quake. Tremors were also felt in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and other North-east Indian States.
II. Problems
On the basis of investigation it has been found that the earthquake and its effects are major problem in
study area. In study area, the region of convergence of Indian plate and Eurasian plate is more vulnerable to
earthquakes. The problem under study is to assess the nature of earthquakes and to determine specifically the
extent of this type of disaster, in details through data generated from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
and Geological Survey of India. The other main problem is to construct unscientific and non-seismically
engineered multi storied buildings which had easily collapsed by the tremor, disrupting civic life in Nepal. This
research work will deal particularly with one of the current issues of consequence of earthquakes as well as
different problem of human beings related with massive damages.
III. Study Area
The Nepal and some districts of north India along the India-Nepal border have been selected for this
study. The study area is bounded by 21°33´07.04´´ N to 30°21´02.53´´ N Latitudes and 77°06´33.77´´ E to

peninsular plateau of India, and displays the typical characteristics of the Himalayan range and its foothills. It is
covering an area of 6, 56,558 sq. km.
Figure: 1. Study area.
IV. Methodology
This research work is based on the empirical study of consequences of earthquakes. A systematic
methodological principle was followed in this study work. The whole work can be represented into three broad
categories which are noted below4.1 Pre field study
At the beginning intensive literature review from related books, journals, articles, government
publication, etc. has been done to specify the research problem and selecting the study area and topic of this
research work.
4.2 Field study
The spatial information collected from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Geological
Survey of India was also taken into consideration. Primary and secondary data has been obtained through
internet and current News Papers. Photographic records of the related features have also been collected from
different sources.
4.3 Post field study
The study of empirical observation has been done very carefully through measurement and analysis
process to know the causes and consequences of quakes. Data and other information available and generated on
the field were compiled using appropriate modern techniques on computer and satellite images, atlas and
different maps. The collected data have been quantified, analyzed and synthesized by using standard statistical
and cartographic methods.
V. Objectives
Severe, precise and rational objectives have been chosen for the scientific study of the above mentioned problem
of the study area, which are noted below:-
1. To highlight the problem of earthquakes in Nepal and its adjacent area.
2. To examine the nature and extent of this.
A Devastating Disaster: A Case Study of Nepal Earthquake and Its Impact on Human Beings
DOI: 10.9790/0837-20752834 www.iosrjournals.org 30 | Page
3. To emphasize the causes and consequences of the tremor of recent quakes.
4. To suggest suitable prevention measures.
VI. Literature Review
After independence some famous scientists and geographers published too many research papers on the
nature and mapping of the Earthquake hazards. Hemmady, A.K.R. published a classic book –„Earthquakes‟
(1996), Bolt, B.A. published „Earthquakes‟ (1993). Another popular article was published by Dakshinaranjan
Nandy (2007) „Mapping Earthquake Hazards‟. About Earthquake hazard predictable, the authentic article was
published in 2007, popularly known as „Observation of pre-seismic signals through Geochemical Monitoring‟
by the senior Scientist and research scholar of Department of Science and Technology and Department of
Atomic Energy, Hirok Chaudhuri, Nisits K. Das, Rakesh K. Bhandari, Debasis Ghose, Prasanta Sen and Bikash
Sinha. Other well-known books are „Earthquake: Forecasting and Mitigation‟ (2004) of H.N. Srivastava;
“Earthquake Prediction” (1975) of F. Press and „Earthquake Prediction Techniques‟ (1982) of Asada, T.
VII. Causes Of Earthquake
Earthquake of Nepal and India along the Himalayan belt were caused mainly due to collision of Indian
plate and Eurasian plate. Deep focus and high magnitudes of earthquakes are caused along the convergent plate
boundaries because of collision of two convergent plates, namely Eurasian and Indian convergent plates. The
subduction of Indian plate below Eurasian plate caused Nepal earthquake at the belt of Himalaya. April 25 and
May 12, 2015 earthquakes had occurred on the northern boundary of the Indian plate which is under thrusting
the Eurasian plate. The main cause of Nepal earthquakes is attributed to the northward movement of Indian
plate. The Indian plate is moving toward north- northeast ward direction at an average rate of about 4.5-5 cm per
annum, which causes a stress. On 25th April 2015, the stress built up as the Indian and Eurasian plates slide
under one other causing earthquake. The epicentre of these two earthquakes has lay on the boundary of these
two plates. The earth quake was caused at the depth of 10 kilometres. The 188 aftershocks measuring around
3.0-6.9 magnitudes in Richter scale were at the depths of 10-50 kilometres. After the major earthquake, the
earth‟s plates lost their equilibrium. The aftershocks are basically nature‟s way to help earth get back its
equilibrium.
VIII. Consequences Of Earthquakes
The hazardous effect of Nepal earthquakes depends not only on their magnitude of Richter scale or
intensity alone, but also on so many factors, such as geology of the earth crust (lithology, elasticity, soil
condition, permissible stress, rock structure, etc.), design of buildings, quality of construction, population
pressure, etc. Several villages, towns, human constructions and their properties, lives were completely damaged.
The urban area of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, was completely destroyed by April earthquake which hit
Nepal. Several buildings collapsed like a pack of cards as if they were mud huts.

 Figure: 2. Affected area of Nepal earthquake.
Several buildings, most of them old, collapsed in the densely populated Kathmandu valley.
Kathmandu‟s Darbar square, a UNESCO world heritage site, was totally damaged in the quake. Harsh damage
took place to the parts of the palace complex in Vasanthapura Square. The site of palaces and temples of the city
were warren of narrow lanes and historic structure. Kathmandu residents ran onto the streets and other open
spaces, throwing up clouds of dust and wide creaks opened on paved streets and the building‟s wall.

Earthquakes are often followed by landslides and rock avalanches and glacier avalanches in Himalayan
hilly areas. The quake caused avalanches on Mount Everest, making the climbers running for cover and killing
at least 18 people at the start of the main climbing season. At least 1000 climbers had been at the base camp of
the Everest when the earthquake struck. The base camp had been severely damaged and the teams were trapped.

Because of poor phone network coverage the government of India and Nepal were struggling to assess the
damage on the Everest.
At Langtang valley in Rasuwa district, a major tourist destination in Nepal, also famous for trekking, it
is said that over 100 people were killed and 120 people were injured or missing following the massive
avalanche which swept away the entire village in the wake of the powerful quake that hit Rasuwa district. . Over
329 people were reported missing after an avalanche struck Ghodatabela and the Langtang villages. The
avalanche was estimated to be 3 kilometres wide.
Continuous aftershocks caused a landslide on the Koshi Highway which blocked the section of the road
between Bhedetar and Mulghat. Many smaller landslides occurred in the Trishuli River Valley with reports of
significant damage at Mailung, Simle, and Archale areas. As a result of landslide the transport system mainly
highways was completely damaged or blocked, which may stop various activities needed for earthquake relief
and rescue. Landslides also blocked the river channels, sewage and other communication system in Nepal and
now in India specially in Darjeeling district.
Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh were the worst affected parts of India. The tremors were felt the
strongest in the districts along the Indo-Nepal border, which lie in the seismic zone V (very high seismic zone).
Mud wall, buildings and boundary walls in different locations of Siliguri and Jalpaiguri had collapsed because
of the tremors. At least 52 people were killed and 237 were injured in India in a powerful earthquake, with
epicentre in Nepal, which destroyed or damaged several houses and buildings in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West
Bengal and surrounding area. According to Union Home Ministry, 38 people died in Bihar, 11 in Uttar Pradesh
and 3 in West Bengal, where 43 school children were injured. The majority of the deaths were reported from the
northern districts bordering Nepal. According to Bihar Disaster Management Department report, 8 people died
in East Champaran district, 6 in Sitamarchi and other 24 death had been reported from Darbhanga, Supual,
Saran, Lakhisarai, Madhubani, West Champaran, Araria and Sheohar districts. Huge damage was caused to the
property and the lives of the people in north India.

April 25 quake left 8,699 people dead, 22,220 people injured and flattened thousands of buildings
besides destroying whole villages in affected area. In Nepal, Over 5, 00,000 houses were destroyed and 2,
69,000 were damaged by the earthquakes and hundreds of thousands of people were still staying in temporary
shelters. More than 8, 64,000 affected people, who lived in remote mountainous area, have lost their relatives
and houses. (UN report)

At least 117 people died in Nepal and 17 people in India as a result of the earthquake of 12 May and
about 2,500 people were injured. This earthquake created cracks on a pillar on the top floor of „Writers‟
Buildings and a pillar inside the Shaheed Minar in Kolkata. At Colleges of North Bengal University, over 1100
students had to write their examination paper on college ground after the second quake.
A number of old temples, pagodas and churches in the Kathmandu valley were razed. Several temples
including Manakamana Temple at Gorkha, Janaki Mandir at Janakpur; Kasthamandap, Panchtale temple,
Basantapur Durbar, the Dasa Avtar temple and the Shiva Parvati temple were demolished. The Kumari Temple
and the Taleju Bhawani Temple partially collapsed. Some portion of the Jaya Bageshwari Temple at Gaushala,
Pashupatinath Temple, Swyambhunath, Boudhanath Stupa, Ratna Mandir and Rani Pokhari had been destroyed.
The Char Narayan Mandir, the statue of Yog Narendra Malla, the Taleju Temple, the Hari Shankar, Uma
Maheshwar Temple and the Machhindranath Temple in Bungamati were destroyed. In Tripureshwar, the Kal
Mochan Ghat, a temple inspired by Mughal architecture, was completely destroyed and the nearby Tripura
Sundari also suffered significant damage. In Bhaktapur, several monuments and Temples were totally destroyed.
The poor communities of Nepal were most affected, who lost their houses and properties. The key reason for the
very high Nepalese casualties was the construction of non-seismically engineered buildings.
The U.S. Geological Survey initially estimated economic losses from this quake at 9 percent to 50
percent of gross domestic product, with an estimate of 35 percent.

IX. Rccomendations
1. During earthquake, you should run towards safe place like an open area away from buildings, electricity
wires, flammable inputs, etc.
2. If you are in a moving car during earthquake, you should stop the car as quickly as possible.
3. If you are staying indoors, you should take shelter under a heavy and hard furniture namely desk, table,
bench, etc.
4. You should not run through or near the buildings; always stay in open space until the tremor stop.
5. You should construct seismically engineered (earthquake resistant design) buildings or light weight
buildings with lighter roofs in highly earthquake prone areas.
X. Findings
From the above comprehensive study I have assembled several important aspects, which are noted below1. Loss of many human and cattle lives.
2. Damage and destruction of many human constructions, namely buildings, roads or highways, bridges,
temples, UNESCO world heritage sites, towns and villages.
3. Earthquake creates landslides which may block the highways, river channels, etc.
4. Earthquake crates different types of avalanches which may kill hundreds of climbers, trekkers and Nepali
guides at the Everest base camp in Nepal.
5. Earthquakes and continuous aftershocks destroyed the civil structures killing thousands of people and
injured over twenty-two thousand people in Nepal and northern India.
XI. Conclusions
An earthquake cannot be prevented or accurately predicted, but there are some forewarning sign of a
coming tremor, and there are various system being developed and in use to reduce the damage from this
disaster. However, no perfect techniques have been developed to predict the tremor till date. Making exact
prediction about the occurrence of a tremor in an area and time is still a tricky proposition. The seismologists are
more and more concentrating on the aspect of earthquake forecasting. When we would be able to predict of
earthquakes accurately on the basis of animal behavior or other unusual phenomena, it would save many lives
and property damages.

respo se t e e ote a eas. nse in the remote areas.
 Temporary settlement of displaced
 Challenge to Challenge to manage the space for rubbles rubbles
CHALLENGES – AT FIELD / OPERATION
LEVEL (IMMEDIATE ACTION)
 Selection of appropriate caring of children with
good faith who lost their parents and
guardians.
 Challenges for immediate repair of rural roads
and for immediate transportation
 Collection of integrated field information and
dissemination
 Lack of office space for the government
operations f as significant number f o
government buildings were damaged /
dt d es royed
CHALLENGES – AT POLICY AND PRACTICE
 Lack of policy, technology, tools and equipment, and
skills to dismantle the damaged structures.
 Challenges to restoration and conservation of cultural
and religious heritages.
 The earthquakes will end up pushing an additional 2.5
to 3.5 percent Nepalese into poverty in 2015-2016 which
t l t i t t l t 700 000 dditi l (PDNA) translates into at least 700,000 additional poor(PDNA)
 The nation will require substantial external assistance
to meet the rehabilitation and reconstruction (NPR 669
billion or US$ 6.7 billion ).
LESSONS LEARNT AND AREAS FOR FUTURE
DIRECTION
 Need of new Disaster Management Act to address the
present h ll c a enges.
 Perfect implementation of building codes. Strictly
monit h i i d d itor mechanism is needed.
 Strengthen the capacity of National Search and
Rescue Team specially focusing for Security forces.
 Assured international supports in Search and Rescue
relief and recovery.
LESSONS LEARNING AND …
 Need of Helipads in Rural Areas, Provision of Helipads
i h C in each VDC
 Emergency warehouse and adequate stockpiling of
appropriate supplies and equipment
 One window system is very imp. in Rescue and Relief
to distribute food and nonfood items in remote areas
and to the backward and deprive people.
 Establishment of call centres in each Village and need
of GIS b d i t t d i f ti t f GIS based integrated information system
 Finally,Recovery should follow a community based
app g roach which encourages communities, utilization
of social networks, and built self reliance efforts using
local skills and Knowledge. It will largely be an owner
driven recovery p g ro ramme

RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION
POLICY/ APPROACH
 Central policy/plan, decentralised
implementation will be adopted.
 Adopt BBB (build back better) principle.
 Owner driven and self reliant effort for
reconstruction in private housing for optimum
utilisation of local resources, skills labour skills, labour
 An effective institutional set up in community
level and capacity building of local people
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE DISASTER
TIME: BELIEFS, SOCIAL HARMONY HARMONY AND
COMMITMENT
 Saturday is a off day in Nepal. Therefore, schools
across Nepal were closed on 25 April. The death
toll of young people could have been much higher
considering that nearly 7,000 schools were
comp y g y g y, letely or significantly damaged. Similarly, if
the earthquake had struck at night, and not in
the middle of the day, there would certainly have
b li been greater casualties.
 Lifelines were remarkably not affected during the
earth k qua e.
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE
DISASTER…
 Th fi t ti f th C t l Di t R li f The first meeting of the Central Disaster Relief
Committee (CDRC) was held immediately after the
first earthquake, with the National Emergency
Operation Centre (NEOC) providing an initial report
to the CDRC recommending a focus on Search and
Rescue ( ), SAR and Disaster Relief Fund was
immediately allocated, and the government’s Cluster
mechanisms, comprising 11 sectors, were instantly
activated.
 The network of NGOs and INGOs based in Nepal
swiftly rallied to support community rescue and relief
eff t S l l t i ll f th fforts. Several volunteer groups, especially of youth
and professionals like doctors and engineers were
active in treating the wounded, setting up temporary
sh l l i f d d di i l d helters, supplying food and attending to vital needs.
POSITIVE ASPECTS DURING THE
DISASTER…
 Strong political will and continuous dialogue with
the affected people are the most important
aspects
 Self reliant and motivated urban youth were
active for rescue and relief activities.
 Social harmony has become great example. Theft
and robbery did not occur.
POSITIVE ASPECTS IN RECOVERY STAGE
 Post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) is
prepared on time.
 International Conference on Nepal's
Reconstruction was held with commitment of
their contribution
 Esa s e t blishment of Naoa ti n l Reco s c o n truction
Authority as an independent authority and
Post Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction
Policy/strategy and guideline are in action .

Casualties	8,962 dead in Nepal,[9][10] 21,952 injured,[9] 3.5 million homeless[9]
The April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake)[8][11] killed 8,962 people and injured 21,952 across the countries of Nepal, India, China and Bangladesh. It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time on Saturday 25 April 2015, with a magnitude of Mw 7.8–7.9[1][12][13] or Ms 8.1[14] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of X (Extreme). Its epicenter was east of Gorkha District at Barpak, Gorkha, roughly 85 km (53 mi) northwest of central Kathmandu, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 8.2 km (5.1 mi).[1] It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–India earthquake.[15][16][17] The ground motion recorded in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, was of low frequency, which, along with its occurrence at an hour when many people in rural areas were working outdoors, decreased the loss of human lives.[18]

The earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 22 people,[19] the deadliest incident on the mountain on record.[20] The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.[21]

Hundreds of thousands of Nepalese were made homeless with entire villages flattened[21][22][23] across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Square, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple, the Boudhanath stupa, and the Swayambhunath stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.[24][25] Dharahara, also called Bhimsen Tower, a nine-storey 61.88-metre (203.0 ft) tall tower, was destroyed. It was a part of the architecture of Kathmandu recognized by UNESCO.

Continued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal at intervals of 15–20 minutes, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST.[7] The country also had a continued risk of landslides.[26]

A major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:50 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.[27] The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mount Everest.[28] More than 200 people were killed and over 2,500 were injured by this aftershock, and many were left homeless.[29]

Earthquake

Map of the earthquake and aftershocks at 12 May, showing location of major historical earthquakes
The earthquake occurred on 25 April 2015 at 11:56 am NST (06:11:25 UTC) at a depth of approximately 8.2 km (5.1 mi) (which is considered shallow and therefore more damaging than quakes that originate deeper in the ground),[30] with its epicentre approximately 34 km (21 mi) southeast of Lamjung, Nepal, lasting approximately 50 seconds.[31] The earthquake was initially reported as Mww 7.5 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) before it was quickly upgraded to Mww  7.8, while the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) reported a magnitude of Mw  7.9.[12][13] The China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC) reported the earthquake's magnitude to be 8.1 Ms . The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said two powerful quakes were registered in Nepal at 06:11 UTC and 06:45 UTC. The first quake had its epicenter was identified at a distance of 80 km to the northwest of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Bharatpur was the nearest major city to the main earthquake, 53 km (33 mi) as the crow flies from the epicenter. The second earthquake was somewhat less powerful at 6.6 Mw . It occurred 65 km (40 mi) east of Kathmandu and its seismic focus lay at a depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) below the earth's surface. Over 38 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 Mw  or greater occurred in the day following the initial earthquake, including one of 6.8 Mw .[32]

According to the USGS, the earthquake was caused by a sudden thrust, a short sharp thrust that caught many unsuspected and dies to this thrust only, along the major fault line where the Indian plate, carrying India, is slowly diving underneath the Eurasian plate, carrying much of Europe and Asia.[30] Kathmandu, situated on a block of crust approximately 120 km (74 miles) wide and 60 km (37 miles) long, rapidly shifted 3 m (10 ft) to the south in a matter of just 30 seconds.[33]

The risk of a large earthquake was well known beforehand. In 2013, in an interview with seismologist Vinod Kumar Gaur, The Hindu quoted him as saying, "Calculations show that there is sufficient accumulated energy [in the Main Frontal Thrust], now to produce an 8-magnitude earthquake. I cannot say when. It may not happen tomorrow, but it could possibly happen sometime this century, or wait longer to produce a much larger one."[34] According to Brian Tucker, founder of a nonprofit organization devoted to reducing casualties from natural disasters, some government officials had expressed confidence that such an earthquake would not occur again. Tucker recounted a conversation he had with a government official in the 1990s who said, "We don't have to worry about earthquakes anymore, because we already had an earthquake." The previous earthquake to which he referred occurred in 1934.[35] In fact, the 600-km-long Central Himalayan Gap hadn't ruptured since 1505.

Geology
Further information: Geology of Nepal and Thrust tectonics

M6+ Himalayan region earthquakes, 1900–2014
Nepal lies towards the southern limit of the diffuse collisional boundary where the Indian plate underthrusts the Eurasian plate,[36][37] occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long Himalayas. Geologically, the Nepal Himalayas are subdivided into five tectonic zones from north to south, east to west, and almost parallel to sub-parallel.[38] These five distinct morpho-geotectonic zones are: (1) Terai Plain; (2) Sub Himalaya (Shivalik Range); (3) Lesser Himalaya (Mahabharat Range and mid valleys); (4) Higher Himalaya; and (5) Inner Himalaya (Tibetan Tethys).[39] Each of these zones is clearly identified by its morphological, geological, and tectonic features.[39]

The convergence rate between the plates in central Nepal is about 45 mm (1.8 in) per year. The location, magnitude, and focal mechanism of the earthquake suggest that it was caused by a slip along the Main Frontal Thrust.[1][40]

The earthquake's effects were amplified in Kathmandu as it sits on the Kathmandu Basin, which contains up to 600 m (2,000 ft) of sedimentary rocks, representing the infilling of a lake.[41]

Based on a study published in 2014, of the Main Frontal Thrust, on average a great earthquake occurs every 750 ± 140 and 870 ± 350 years in the east Nepal region.[42] A study from 2015 found a 700-year delay between earthquakes in the region. The study also suggests that because of tectonic stress buildup, the 1934 earthquake and the 2015 quake are connected, following a historic earthquake pattern.[43] A 2016 study on historical great (M ≥ 8) earthquake pairs and cycles found that associated great earthquakes are likely to occur in the West China region through the 2020s.[44]

Intensity

USGS shakemap
According to the USGS website, the maximum intensity was VIII (Severe), however certain reports state an intensity of X (Extreme) or higher.[1] In most of Kathmandu the intensity was VIII-IX, as evidenced by the numerous undamaged water towers installed on top of undamaged multi story buildings. Tremors were felt in the neighboring Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Sikkim, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, in the National Capital Region around New Delhi and as far south as Karnataka.[45] Damage was extensive in northern Bihar and minor damage was also reported from parts of Odisha.[45] Shaking was felt in high-rise buildings as far as Kochi in the southern state of Kerala.[45] The intensity in Patna was V (Moderate).[46][failed verification] The intensity was IV (Light) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[1] The earthquake was also experienced across southwest China, ranging from the Tibet Autonomous Region to Chengdu, which is 1,900 km (1,200 mi) away from the epicenter.[47] Tremors were felt in Pakistan[48] and Bhutan.[1][45]

Aftershocks
Main article: List of aftershocks of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake

Aftershocks of 2015 Nepal earthquake
A series of aftershocks began immediately after the mainshock, at intervals of 15–30 minutes, with one aftershock reaching 6.6Mw within 34 minutes of the initial quake. A major aftershock of magnitude 6.9 Mw occurred on 26 April 2015 in the same region at 12:54 NST (07:08 UTC), with an epicenter located about 17 km (11 mi) south of Kodari, Nepal.[48][49] The aftershock caused fresh avalanches on Mount Everest and was felt in many places in northern India including Kolkata, Siliguri, Jalpaiguri, and Assam.[50] The aftershock caused a landslide on the Koshi Highway, which blocked the section of the road between Bhedetar and Mulghat.[51]

A model of GeoGateway, based on a United States Geological Survey mechanism of a near-horizontal fault as well as the location of aftershocks showed that the fault had an 11° dip towards the north, striking at 295°, was 50 km (31 mi) wide, 150 km (93 mi) long, and had a dip slip of 3 m (9.8 ft).[52] The USGS says the aftershock registered at a shallow depth of 10 km (6.2 mi).[50]

As of 24 May 2016, 459 aftershocks had occurred with different epicenters and magnitudes equal to or above 4 Mw (out of which 51 aftershocks are equal to or above 5 Mw and 5 aftershocks above 6 Mw) and more than 20,000 aftershocks less than 4 Mw.[8]

12 May 2015 earthquake
Main article: May 2015 Nepal earthquake
A second major earthquake occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:50 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3Mw 18 km (11 mi) southeast of Kodari. The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital city of Kathmandu and Mount Everest. It struck at a depth of 18.5 km (11.5 miles). This earthquake occurred along the same fault as the original magnitude 7.8 earthquake of 25 April but further to the east. As such, it is considered an aftershock of the 25 April quake.[53] Tremors were also felt in northern parts of India including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and other North-Indian States.[54][55][56][57] At least 153 people died in Nepal as a result of the aftershock and about 2,500 were injured. 62 others died in India, two in Bangladesh, and one in China.[29][58]

Aftermath
See also: Nepal humanitarian crisis (2015-2017)
Disastrous events in very poor and politically paralyzed nations such as Nepal often become a long drawn out chain of events, in that one disaster feeds into another for years or even decades on end. The aftereffects of the earthquake had subsequent effects on a myriad of things: human trafficking, labour cost and availability, rental and property cost burdens, urbanization, private and public debt burdens, mental health, politics, tourism, disease, and damage to the healthcare system.[59] A survey some 30 months later found only 12% of the reconstruction money had been distributed, and those without land were locked out of financial support, exacerbating the social divide and feeding marginalization.

More direct effects
Some disasters that came with the monsoon season were suspected to be related to the earthquake. There was a landslip on 11 June, killing 53 people.[60] Meanwhile, a glacial lake had burst in the particularly hard-hit Solukhumbhu district.[61] Whether or not the quake contributed to such events is often unknown and unresearched, but it is certainly possible.

Casualties
Nepal
The earthquake killed at least 8,857 people in Nepal[9][86][87] and injured nearly three times as many. The rural death toll may have been minimized by the fact that most villagers were outdoors working when the quake hit.[88] As of 15 May, 6,271 people, including 1,700 from the 12 May aftershock, were still receiving treatment for their injuries.[58] Nearly 3.5 million people were left homeless, causing around 2.6 million internal displacements.[62][89]

The example of this earthquake shows that loss calculations for hypothetical likely future earthquakes can be reasonably reliable. In 2005, the expected numbers of fatalities due to a hypothetical scenario earthquake near Kathmandu for M8.1 was published.[90] The fatalities at that time were estimated between 21,000 and 42,000. The M7.8 earthquake of 25 April 2015 killed about 8,800 people because it occurred on a Saturday and so many buildings that collapsed, such as schools and municipal buildings, were empty, reducing the death toll. In addition, the epicentre of the earthquake was in a rural setting, so the worst hit districts had low population densities and most of the population was outside when the earthquake hit.[91] Had the earthquake occurred at night or during the working week, when many more people were inside vulnerable buildings, the death toll would have likely been much closer to the modelled estimate.

A .
Fatality reports by the media as a function of time, compared to the QLARM calculation (horizontal line) made after the rupture area of the Kathmandu earthquake had been mapped. Uncertainty extent given by the vertical solid line. The source for news reports is the NINTRAS web site of the Swiss Seismological Service. All reports, including lower values exceeded by others, are given.
After the rupture area of the Kathmandu 2015 earthquake had been derived[92] and the intensities of shaking had been mapped,[93] a line source model for losses could be constructed with energy being radiated along the entire rupture.[94] The fatalities estimated in this way by QLARM agree with those reported in the end. The figure shows reports of fatalities as a function of time. News reports significantly underestimated the actual numbers of fatalities for several days.

The Himalayan Times reported that as many as 20,000 foreign nationals may have been visiting Nepal at the time of the earthquake, although reports of foreign deaths were relatively low.[citation needed]

India
A total of 78 deaths were reported in India – including 58 in Bihar, 16 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in West Bengal and 1 in Rajasthan.[63]

China
Twenty-seven people were confirmed dead, 383 were injured and 4 were missing, all from the Tibet Autonomous Region.[64] The quake destroyed 2,500 houses and damaged 24,700 others across 19 counties in Tibet, affecting nearly 300,000 people, among whom 47,500 were displaced, while A total of 82 temples were also damaged.[64] The counties of Gyirong, Nyalam and Tingri in Xigazê were worst hit, where nearly 80 percent of the houses in the three counties collapsed.[64]

Bangladesh
Four people were killed and 18 districts were affected by the earthquake in Bangladesh.[65] A six-story building partially collapsed and two garment factories tilted in Dhaka.[65] A 22-year-old man died when trying to flee the Dhaka Medical College in a panic.[65] In Tangail, a woman died trying to escape a building.[65] Another woman was crushed to death by a collapsed wall while a teacher died of a heart attack during the earthquake.[65]

Avalanches on Mount Everest
Main article: 2015 Mount Everest avalanches
This earthquake caused avalanches on Mount Everest. At least 19 died,[95] with at least 120 others injured or missing.[95]

Landslides in the Langtang Valley
In the Langtang valley located in Langtang National Park, 329 people were reported missing after an avalanche hit the village of Ghodatabela[96][97] and the village of Langtang. The avalanche was estimated to have been two to three kilometres wide. Ghodatabela was an area popular on the Langtang trekking route.[98] The village of Langtang was destroyed by the avalanche. Smaller settlements on the outskirts of Langtang were buried during the earthquake, such as Chyamki, Thangsyap, and Mundu. Twelve locals and two foreigners were believed to have survived. Smaller landslides occurred in the Trishuli River Valley with reports of significant damage at Mailung, Simle, and Archale.[99][100] On 4 May it was announced that 52 bodies had been found in the Langtang area, of which seven were of foreigners.[101]

According to geological models, the frequency and intensity of future landslides in the Langtang Valley is due to increase in the coming decades.[102] This is attributable directly to the effect of the earthquake, which caused widespread fracturing in the grounds of the Langtang area.[103]

Damage

People waiting on airport tarmac for flights after aftershocks forced the airport to open all exit doors

Damage in the Basantpur Durbar Square
Thousands of houses were destroyed across many districts of the country, with entire villages flattened, especially those near the epicenter.[21][22][23]

The Tribhuvan International Airport serving Kathmandu was closed immediately after the earthquake, but was re-opened later in the day for relief operations and, later, for some commercial flights.[104] It subsequently shut down operations sporadically due to aftershocks,[105] and on 3 May was closed temporarily to the largest planes for fear of runway damage.[106] During strong aftershocks, the airport opened all boarding-lounge exit doors onto the tarmac, allowing people who were waiting post security and immigration to flee to the open spaces of the runway tarmac. Many remained outside as planes were delayed and the airport swelled to capacity. The airport facilities suffered damage and there was no running water or operating toilets in the airport lounges. Few airport workers were at their posts; most were killed in the earthquake or had to deal with its aftereffects.[107]

Flights resumed from Pokhara, to the west of the epicentre, on 27 April.[108]


Kathmandu Durbar Square before the earthquake
Several of the churches in the Kathmandu valley were destroyed. As Saturday is the principal day of Christian worship in Nepal, 500 people were reported to have died in the collapses.[109][110]

Several temples on Kathmandu Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, collapsed,[31] as did the Dharahara tower, built in 1832; the collapse of the latter structure killed at least 180 people,[111][112][113][114] Manakamana Temple in Gorkha, previously damaged in an earlier quake, tilted several inches further. The northern side of Janaki Mandir in Janakpur was reported to have been damaged.[citation needed] Several temples, including Kasthamandap, Panchtale temple, the top levels of the nine-story Basantapur Durbar, the Dasa Avtar temple and two shrines located behind the Shiva Parvati temple were demolished by the quake. Some other monuments including the Taleju Bhawani Temple partially collapsed.[115][116]

The top of the Jaya Bageshwari Temple in Gaushala and some parts of the Pashupatinath Temple, Swyambhunath, Boudhanath Stupa, Ratna Mandir, inside Rani Pokhari, and Durbar High School have been destroyed.[117]

In Patan, the Char Narayan Mandir, the statue of Yog Narendra Malla, a pati inside Patan Durbar Square, the Taleju Temple, the Hari Shankar, Uma Maheshwar Temple and the Machhindranath Temple in Bungamati were destroyed. In Tripureshwar, the Kal Mochan Ghat, a temple inspired by Mughal architecture, was completely destroyed and the nearby Tripura Sundari also suffered significant damage. In Bhaktapur, several monuments, including the Phasi Deva temple, the Chardham temple and the 17th century Vatsala Durga Temple were fully or partially destroyed.[117]

Outside the Valley, the Manakamana Temple in Gorkha, the Gorkha Durbar, the Palanchok Bhagwati, in Kabhrepalanchok District, the Rani Mahal in Palpa District, the Churiyamai in Makwanpur District, the Dolakha Bhimsensthan in Dolakha District, and the Nuwakot Durbar suffered varying degrees of damage. Historian Prushottam Lochan Shrestha stated, "We have lost most of the monuments that had been designated as World Heritage Sites in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur District, Nepal. They cannot be restored to their original states."[117] The northeastern parts of India also received major damage. Heavy shocks were felt in the states of Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and others. Huge damage was caused to the property and the lives of the people.

Concern was expressed that harvests could be reduced or lost this season as people affected by the earthquake would have only a short time to plant crops before the onset of the Monsoon rains.[118]

Nepal, with a total Gross Domestic Product of US$19.921 billion (according to a 2012 estimate),[119] is one of Asia's poorest countries, and has little ability to fund a major reconstruction effort on its own.[120] Even before the quake, the Asian Development Bank estimated that it would need to spend about four times more than it currently does annually on infrastructure through to 2020 to attract investment.[120] The U.S. Geological Survey initially estimated economic losses from the tremor at 9 per cent to 50 per cent of gross domestic product, with a best guess of 35 per cent. "It's too hard for now to tell the extent of the damage and the effect on Nepal's GDP", according to Hun Kim, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) official. The ADB said on the 28th that it would provide a US$3 million grant to Nepal for immediate relief efforts, and up to US$200 million for the first phase of rehabilitation.[120]

Rajiv Biswas, an economist at a Colorado-based consultancy, said that rebuilding the economy will need international effort over the next few years as it could "easily exceed" US$5 billion.[120][121][failed verification]

More recent studies estimate the damage from the earthquake to be closer to US$10 billion (which would be around 50% of Nepals GDP at the time).[122]

Social effects
It was reported that the survivors were preyed upon by human traffickers involved in the supply of girls and women to the brothels of South Asia. These traffickers took advantage of the chaos that resulted from the aftermath of the earthquake.[123] The most affected were women from poor communities who lost their homes.[124] In response to the unsafe conditions of the temporary campsites, international organizations implemented Safety Committees which were provided cash grants for necessities like additional toilets and bathrooms.[125]

Most affected
Single women had very little access to relief, according to a report by the Inter-party Women's Alliance (IPWA). The report also found that violence and rapes against women and minors have increased after the earthquake.[126] Additionally, the earthquake has significantly affected certain groups of people. Tibeto-Burman peoples were hardest hit as they tend to inhabit the higher slopes of mountains as opposed to the central valleys and are less educated and connected. All of these factors make them harder to access. According to a government survey, malnutrition in children has worsened considerably some 3 months after the quake, with the most undernourished being Tamang and Chepang peoples.[127] Before the quake, 41 percent of children under five were stunted, 29 percent were underweight and 11 percent were emaciated, according to the World Food Programme.[127]

Disease
Though a feared mass cholera outbreak failed to materialize (there were sporadic reports), other outbreaks were reported. At least 13 people died of scrub typhus while 240 people were taken ill since the disease was first diagnosed in the country in August 2015 until September 2016.[128] The mental and emotional impact of an earthquake is the other invisible disaster.[129] Medical Doctors from India, Ramachandra Kamath, Edmond Fernandes and Prakash Narayan stated that elderly care in disaster was more important than women and child focused one for Nepal earthquake and absence of military support for medical aid providers impacted relief work.[130]

Rescue and relief
About 90% of soldiers from the Nepalese Army were sent to the stricken areas in the aftermath of the earthquake under Operation Sankat Mochan, with volunteers mobilized from other parts of the country.[131] Rainfall and aftershocks were factors complicating the rescue efforts, with potential secondary effects like additional landslides and further building collapses being concerns. Impassable roads and damaged communications infrastructure posed substantial challenges to rescue efforts.[132] Survivors were found up to a week after the earthquake.[133][134][135]

As of 1 May international aid agencies like Médecins Sans Frontières and the Red Cross were able to start medically evacuating the critically wounded by helicopter from outlying areas, initially cut-off from the capital city, Kathmandu,[22] and treating others in mobile and makeshift facilities.[136][137] There was concern about epidemics due to the shortage of clean water, the makeshift nature of living conditions and the lack of toilets.[138]

Emergency workers were able to identify four men who had been trapped in rubble, and rescue them, using advanced heartbeat detection. The four men were trapped in up to ten feet of rubble in the village of Chautara, north of Kathmandu. An international team of rescuers from several countries using FINDER devices found two sets of men under two different collapsed buildings.[139]

Volunteers used crisis mapping to help plan emergency aid work.[140] Local organization Kathmandu Living Labs helped coordinate local knowledge on the ground and collaborated with international crisis mapping and humanitarian organizations. Public volunteers from around the world participated in crowdmapping and added details into online maps.[141][142][143][144][145][146][147] Information was mapped from data input from social media, satellite pictures[148] and drones[140] of passable roads, collapsed houses, stranded, shelterless and starving people, who needed help, and from messages and contact details of people willing to help.[149] On-site volunteers verified these mapping details wherever they could to reduce errors. The technologies used by Kathmandu Living Labs were built on top of existing open source solutions which allowed them to work in a fast and cost effective manner.[150]

Digital mappers, through the Kathmandu Living Labs, were already charting the densely populated Kathmandu Valley, and then focused on earthquake relief. "They were doing an inventory in the poorer communities where they didn't have a very good sense of the quality of buildings," says Cowan, whose students helped add Kathmandu's buildings and roads to OpenStreetMap. First responders, from Nepalese citizens to the Red Cross, the Nepal army and the United Nations used this data. The Nepal earthquake crisis mapping utilized experience gained and lessons learned about planning emergency aid work from earthquakes in Haiti and Indonesia.[151]

India pledged to donate $1 billion in cash and materials to Nepal. India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said "I am happy to announce Government of India's pledge for Nepal's post-earthquake reconstruction of Nepali Rupees 10,000 crores, equivalent to one billion US dollars, one fourth of it as Grant." The International Conference on Nepal's Reconstruction has been organised by the Nepalese government to raise funds for rebuilding the country.[152]

Reports are also coming in of sub-standard relief materials and inedible food being sent to Nepal by many of the foreign aid agencies.[153][154]

A United States Marine Corps helicopter crashed on 12 May while involved in delivering relief supplies. The Bell UH-1Y Venom crashed at Charikot, roughly 45 miles (72 kilometres) east of Kathmandu. Two Nepalese soldiers and six American Marines died in the crash.[155]

Need-fulfillment application, Getmii, launched a special pilot version in partnership with the Red Cross to double daily blood donors at the Kathmandu donation center using the app.[156]

Imaging technologies such as satellites and smartphones, were instrumental to relief efforts in Nepal.[157] GLIMS, group of volunteer scientists from nine nations, were able to provide rapid, systematic mapping of the damaged area, allowing the investigation of earthquake-induced geo-hazard processes that provided information to relief and recovery officials on the same timeframe as those operations were occurring.[158]

Charities and Crowdfunding platforms received over $230 million in donations from support groups. The money was used to provide medical supplies, for reconstruction of damaged buildings including schools and hospitals, and building orphanages for the victims among other things.[159]

Repair and reconstruction
Monuments


Patan Durbar Square's Hari Shankar Temple completely collapsed after 2015 earthquake (left), and after its full restoration; pictured in 2023 (right)
UNESCO and the Ministry of Culture began strengthening damaged monuments in danger of collapsing before the monsoon season. Subsequent restoration of collapsed structures, including historic houses is planned. Architectural drawings exist that provide plans for reconstruction. According to UNESCO, more than 30 monuments in the Kathmandu Valley collapsed in the quakes, and another 120 incurred partial damage.[160] Repair estimates are $160 million to restore 1,000 damaged and destroyed monasteries, temples, historic houses, and shrines across the country. The destruction is concentrated in the Kathmandu Valley. UNESCO designated seven groups of multi-ethnic monuments clustered in the valley as a single World Heritage Site, including Swayambhu, the three squares namely Durbar square of Kathmandu, Patan Durbar Square, and Bhaktapur Durbar Square, and the Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changu Narayan. Out of them only three were damaged in the quakes—three Durbar squares, the temple of Changu Narayan, and the 1655 temple in Sankhu.[161] Drones fly above cultural heritage sites to provide 3D images of the damage to use for planning repairs.[162]

Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program
After an international donors conference held in Kathmandu on 25 June 2015 a multi donor trust fund of US$4.4 billion was established to aid the reconstruction of affected housing in 14 districts of Nepal.[163][164] This covered 66 per cent of the country's total recovery and reconstruction needs of US$6.7 billion.[163] Implementation of the Program consisted of five phases i.e. Survey, Identification and Validation, Enrollment, Reconstruction and Completion.[165] The data collection for the program was done digitally using tablets and resulted in collection of over 10 TB of data.[166] The data was openly released to the public by the National Planning Commission and is available for download on their website.[167]

International aid
Main article: Humanitarian response to the 2015 Nepal earthquake
See also: 2015–2017 Nepal humanitarian crisis
A total of $3bn was pledged by donors to help rebuild Nepal.[168][169] UNICEF said close to 1.7 million children had been driven out into the open, and were in desperate need of drinking water, psychological counsel, temporary shelters, sanitation and protection from disease outbreak. It distributed water, tents, hygiene kits, water purification tablets and buckets.[170] Numerous other organizations provided similar support.[171]

India was the first to respond within hours, being Nepal's immediate neighbour,[172] with Operation Maitri which provided rescue and relief by its armed forces. It also evacuated its own and other countries' stranded nationals. India has been the largest aid donor to Nepal following the earthquake with a billion dollar support apart from other non-monetary reliefs extended.[152] China, the Asian Development Bank and the United Kingdom provided significant bilateral aid and other nations and organisations provided aid, rescue teams and helicopters as requested by the Nepalese government.[173][174][175]

On 26 April 2015, international aid agencies and governments mobilized rescue workers and aid for the earthquake. They faced challenges in both getting assistance to Nepal and ferrying people to remote areas as the country had few helicopters.[176][177] Relief efforts were also hampered by Nepalese government insistence on routing aid through the Prime Minister's Disaster Relief Fund and its National Emergency Operation Center. After concerns were raised, it was clarified that "Non-profits" or NGOs already in the country could continue receiving aid directly and bypass the official fund.[176][178] Aid mismatch and supply of "leftovers" by donors,[179] aid diversion in Nepal,[180] mistrust over control of the distribution of funds and supplies,[181][182][183] congestion and customs delays at Kathmandu's airport and border check posts were also reported.[184][185] On 3 May 2015, restrictions were placed on heavy aircraft flying in aid supplies after new cracks were noticed on the runway at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal's only airport able to handle larger jet aircraft.[186][187]

The list below gives a break-up of pledged donations, by each nation, along with aid in kind, delivered immediately.[188]

[346]RAF Chinooks recalled from Nepal quake effort without flying a mission
This article is more than 10 years old
Three UK helicopters were sent to help relief operation after last month’s disaster, but Nepalese government decided not to use them

Three RAF Chinook helicopters sent to help the Nepal earthquake relief effort are being recalled to Britain without flying a single mission after the Nepalese government turned down the chance to use them.

The twin-rotor aircraft were dispatched after the devastating earthquake, which killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands more in desperate need of aid. But the three helicopters, each capable of carrying up to 55 soldiers plus equipment, never left their base in Chandigarh, in India, because the government of Nepal decided it did not want to use them.

The Chinooks, along with 100 personnel, were deployed two weeks ago to help ferry supplies to isolated towns and villages which had been cut-off by the 7.8-magnitude quake. At the time, Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said: “These highly versatile Royal Air Force helicopters and UN aircraft will mean life-saving aid supplies can be moved around Nepal and reach people in remote communities cut off by the earthquake who are in desperate need.”

A government spokesman said on Friday that it was up to the Nepalese authorities to decide how to organise the humanitarian response. “We are disappointed that our Chinooks will not be supporting the World Food Programme’s request for help in distributing aid, but all decisions in relation to the relief effort are ultimately for the government of Nepal to take,” the spokesman said.

“The UK has been the biggest bilateral aid donor to Nepal in response to last month’s devastating earthquake, contributing over £23m, and we will continue to support the ongoing relief effort.”

Gurkha engineers from the British Army and a 60-strong search and rescue team have also been sent to Nepal from the UK, as well as more than 18 tonnes of shelter kits, lanterns and other essential supplies.

The Nepalese government has made an urgent request for helicopters to cope with an escalating humanitarian crisis after Saturday’s devastating earthquake.

The death toll has risen to 6,260 and authorities say it could top 10,000. Thousands are still missing.

Thousands more remain stranded in mountain villages, with just 20 helicopters available for rescue and relief operations. In a region that stretches hundreds of miles, authorities say they are in desperate need of more resources. The small fleet has also been hampered by maintenance problems.

A mood of panic has led to fights breaking out among those anxious to board helicopters. About 1,000 EU citizens remain unaccounted for after the quake, which hit during the height of the trekking season, according to the EU ambassador to Nepal, Rensje Teerink.

The British Government has announced that three RAF CH-47 Chinook helicopters will arrive in the country in the next few days. A team of Gurkha engineers has arrived aboard a C-17, along with 18 tonnes of supplies including shelter kits and solar lanterns.

The Nepalese government, which has admitted failures in its response, said it would give the equivalent of £680 to families of each victim killed in the earthquake, and another £270 for funeral costs, according to Nepal Radio. Locals have accused the government of being too slow to distribute aid.

Meanwhile, 13 of the UK’s leading humanitarian agencies delivering aid to Nepal have warned that hundreds of thousands living out in the open will be particularly vulnerable to the coming Monsoon.

As rains intensified throughout May before the monsoon season in June, there was a real risk of waterborne disease outbreaks such as cholera and diarrhoea, the Disasters Emergency Committee said.

In Kathmandu, bodies were still being pulled from the debris of ruined buildings, and unclaimed bodies were quickly cremated to prevent the spread of disease.

Amid the tragedy of the week’s events, a glimmer of hope shone through, after a girl was born to a young Nepalese couple at a temporary field hospital.

KATMANDU, Nepal — Each time this city shuddered with aftershocks from the earthquake that convulsed Nepal, Samaj Gautam felt an urge to join the millions of residents who fled to safety outdoors. But working in a hospital emergency ward inundated with the wounded, and their broken limbs, fractured skulls and other physical traumas, Dr. Gautam said Sunday night, he and his colleagues had to suppress their fears and stick to treating patients.

“I’m feeling exhausted but also scared because the tremors have been by the dozens,” Dr. Gautam said as he worked through his own exhaustion in the emergency ward of Bir Hospital in Katmandu, where he had been since soon after the earthquake hit Saturday. “But the most worrying thing to me is the aftereffect. Sanitation, disease, these are also serious worries.”

By Monday afternoon, Nepalese authorities had sharply raised the death toll to more than 3,400, but the full extent of the devastation and death was still unclear. It was that uncertainty, over what the earthquake had wrought and what the future might hold, that spread fear and anxiety across Nepal. The true extent of disasters like the one that hit Saturday often become clear only in the days and weeks afterward, as the digging-out gains momentum and crews work through the rubble of lives upended.


But for now, getting through the day — and night — is the immediate challenge as aftershock after aftershock continues to rattle this country and its unnerved people. In the capital, Katmandu, as if the powerful earthquake were not enough of a test, heavy rains pelted the thousands who sought safety in the streets, cowering under leaking tarpaulins and makeshift tents, wondering what had become of homes, lives and livelihoods thrown into limbo by the quake.

“We don’t have anyplace to go,” said Mohammed Kabil, one of a dozen or so men who were warming themselves near a smoky campfire as the drizzle turned to rain. They sat near the remains of the Dharahara Tower, a revered monument that was toppled by the quake.

Satisfied with coordination of foreign relief aid, says Army chief

KATHMANDU, MAY 02 - Nepal is satisfied with the level of coordination with the Nepal Army and among foreign militaries carrying out relief missions the last few days in quake-hit areas, according to Chief of Army Staff (CoAS) Gaurav SJB Rana.

Given the size of the Great Earthquake and the logistics involved in the subsequent relief operations, coordination was always going to be difficult, said CoAS Rana on Friday at a press briefing organised at the Army Headquarters. “This is nothing unique about Nepal. It takes a while to get the coordination right,” he said.

Asked if he was content with coordination among foreign missions and between the Nepal Army and the civilian leadership, Rana said that it was important to be patient. “If we have decided to seek international assistance, we can’t afford to be too demanding,” said Rana.

“We are aware of our national interest, which is now to look after the people who have suffered.”

The Nepal Army had invited a select group of editors to explain its position following news reports quoting Nepali officials expressing displeasure over the lack of coordination between the Nepal Army and foreign missions.

An International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) team, supposed to arrive within 30 hours of a disaster, had failed to do so, claimed CoAS Rana. “The Nepal Army and the police moved in immediately,” he said. It was important to operate within the National Disaster Relief Framework (NDRF), said Rana. “We were trained for this and we knew there were certain choke points, one of which is the [Kathmandu] airport.”

“There’s massive international support and it will reach the needy,” explained Rana. “But large cargo planes have arrived and we don’t have the airlift capacity.”

“The existing [relief] framework needs to be followed, not duplicated. We have the Indian Air Force in one sector, the Chinese and Americans in another,” said Rana. He also spoke on allegations that relief materials were taxed at the borders. “I have asked the prime minister and the finance minister to look into it,” he said.

KATHMANDU, 29 April 2015 – Around 1.7 million children are now in urgent need of aid in the areas worst-hit by the earthquake in Nepal, according to UNICEF.

The children’s organisation revealed the figure as it launched a US$50.35 million appeal to get humanitarian assistance to children and their families amid growing risk of disease outbreaks.  The appeal is UNICEF’s portion of a new inter-agency fundraising ask to meet immediate needs over the next three months.

The 7.9 magnitude earthquake has killed almost 5000 people and injured more than 9700. It has also driven tens of thousands of people into open spaces and temporary camps in the Kathmandu valley and the rest of the worst-affected districts. 

“The lives of so many children have been torn apart and they are in desperate need of life-saving support, including clean water, shelter and sanitation,” says Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF Nepal Representative.

"Without a safe water supply, waterborne diseases remain huge risks for children. Many families are struggling simply to protect themselves from the sun and rain and we only expect needs to grow in the coming days as we receive more information from remoter areas and the full scale of the disaster becomes more apparent."

UNICEF is working with partners to deliver vital humanitarian assistance including clean water and shelter.

Latest updates from UNICEF's response include:

• Tents, hygiene kits, water purification tablets and buckets have been dispatched to Gorkha for distribution, the area at the epicentre of the earthquake, where the presence of dead bodies poses the risk of disease outbreak.  Vital supplies have also been dispatched to Kavre and Dhading.

• UNICEF is delivering water purification tablets, buckets and hygiene kits in Bhaktapur where only 1 in 5 people are estimated to have access to clean water. 

• Water tankers are distributing clean water to 16 informal camps that have sprung up in the Kathmandu valley.

• Teams are identifying and assisting children who have been separated from their families

• UNICEF is working with partners to provide psychological support for children living in informal camps who have experienced extreme shock

More than 80 per cent of health facilities in the five most severely affected districts have been extensively damaged, with treatment taking place outside.  274 out of 323 schools assessed in 16 affected districts are either partially or fully damaged – highlighting the need for temporary learning spaces to protect children and allow them to establish a routine.

Abstract
On 25 April 2015, a large earthquake of Mw 7.8 occurred along the Main Himalayan Thrust fault in central Nepal. It
was caused by a collision of the Indian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. The epicenter was near the Gorkha region,
80 km northwest of Kathmandu, and the rupture propagated toward east from the epicentral region passing
through the sediment-filled Kathmandu Valley. This event resulted in over 8000 fatalities, mostly in Kathmandu and
the adjacent districts. We succeeded in observing strong ground motions at our four observation sites (one rock
site and three sedimentary sites) in the Kathmandu Valley during this devastating earthquake. While the observed
peak ground acceleration values were smaller than the predicted ones that were derived from the use of a ground
motion prediction equation, the observed peak ground velocity values were slightly larger than the predicted ones.
The ground velocities observed at the rock site (KTP) showed a simple velocity pulse, resulting in monotonic-step
displacements associated with the permanent tectonic offset. The vertical ground velocities observed at the
sedimentary sites had the same pulse motions that were observed at the rock site. In contrast, the horizontal
ground velocities as well as accelerations observed at three sedimentary sites showed long duration with
conspicuous long-period oscillations, due to the valley response. The horizontal valley response was characterized
by large amplification (about 10) and prolonged oscillations. However, the predominant period and envelope shape
of their oscillations differed from site to site, indicating a complicated basin structure. Finally, on the basis of the
velocity response spectra, we show that the horizontal long-period oscillations on the sedimentary sites had
enough destructive power to damage high-rise buildings with natural periods of 3 to 5 s.

Introduction
The Himalayan mountain range formed by the collision
of the Indian and Eurasian plates is regarded as an
earthquake prone zone. The Indian Plate underthrusts
the Eurasian Plate in this region, and a number of large
earthquakes have occurred in the Himalayas. Kathmandu,
the capital city of Nepal, is located in the Kathmandu
Valley. The valley is surrounded by mountains on all sides
and is filled with soft lake sediments of Plio-Pleistocene
origin (Dhital 2015); the thickness of the sediments is
more than 650 m in the central part of the valley
(Moribayashi and Maruo 1980). Large earthquakes in
the past have caused significant damage in the
Kathmandu Valley; for example, during the 1934
Nepal-Bihar earthquake (Mw 8.2), nearly 19 % of the
buildings were destroyed inside the valley and more
than 8000 people from all over the country lost their
lives (Dixit et al. 2013). The principal factor associated with the significant damage is considered to have
been the responses of soft lake sediments during
seismic motion. Considering these tectonic and site
conditions within the Kathmandu Valley, we have
established four strong-motion array observation
stations (one rock site and three sedimentary sites) in

the valley to understand the site effects of the
Kathmandu Valley to strong ground motion. These
sites were established on 20 September 2011.
On 25 April 2015, a large Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred
along the Himalayan front (USGS 2015a). This event
had a low-angle thrust faulting mechanism and an 8.2-
km hypocentral depth (USGS 2015a). The epicenter was
near the Gorkha region, 80 km northwest of the
Kathmandu Valley, and the rupture propagated eastward
from the epicentral region passing through the
Kathmandu Valley (e.g., Avouac et al. 2015; Fan and
Shearer 2015; Galetzka et al. 2015; Grandin et al. 2015;
Hayes et al. 2015; Kobayashi et al. 2015; Yagi and
Okuwaki 2015). This event resulted in over 8000
fatalities, which occurred mostly in Kathmandu and in
adjacent districts (MoHA 2015). Although the earthquake vulnerability of Kathmandu was considerably
serious, there were only two official seismometers recording earthquakes on the sedimentary sites: KATNP by
USGS (2015b) and DMG (Bhattarai et al. 2015). We succeeded in observing strong ground motions at our array
sites in the Kathmandu Valley during this devastating
earthquake. In this letter, we describe the characteristics
of the ground motions observed in the Kathmandu Valley
and perform a simple examination of the long-period
valley response in the frequency domain. Finally, we
discuss the velocity response spectra for the horizontal
ground motions. Data used in this letter include the
ground motions observed by the Faculty of Engineering,
Hokkaido University in collaboration with the Central
Department of Geology, Tribhuvan University, Nepal,
and also those observed by some other organizations
(Galetzka et al. 2015; USGS 2015b).
Strong-motion array observations in the
Kathmandu Valley
Accelerometers have been installed at the following four
sites along a straight (west to east) profile in the
Kathmandu Valley: KTP (Kirtipur Municipality Office,
Kirtipur), TVU (Central Department of Geology, Tribhuvan
University, Kirtipur), PTN (Pulchowk Campus, Institute
of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Patan), and THM
(University Grants Commission Office, Sanothimi,
Bhaktapur). The site locations are shown in Fig. 1a. We
collected data using highly damped moving coil type
(dimensionless damping constant h ~ 26, natural frequency of 3 Hz) Mitsutoyo JEP-6A3-2 accelerometers
(Kudo et al. 2002) and Hakusan DATAMARK LS-8800
data loggers at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The data
loggers can perform GPS time calibration. Due to long
hours of power outage in Kathmandu, the observation
system is powered by chargeable batteries and voltage
stabilizers for smooth operation. The accelerometer has
a flat response (−3 dB) of ground acceleration from
Fig. 1 Location map. a Observation sites in the Kathmandu Valley with geological formations (modified from Shrestha et al. 1998). Strong-motion
accelerometer (SMA) stations are divided into HU-TU (Hokkaido University and Tribhuvan University; red) and USGS sites (green). The GPS stations
were used in Galetzka et al. (2015). b The epicenter of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake is shown by the red star. The fault plane shown with the
red rectangular and the focal mechanism are estimated by USGS (2015a)

0.1 Hz to an aliasing frequency (Kudo et al. 2002). It is
necessary to apply a correction of the sensor-response
to the observed records in order to derive accurate
ground motions (Kudo et al. 2002). We installed these
instruments on the first floor of reinforced concrete
buildings that were one- to four-stories high, and the
accelerometers were fixed to the floor with bolts. We
have recorded data continuously at the four sites for
over 2 years. We had observed and analyzed the data
from a few moderate-size earthquakes (Bijukchhen
et al. 2015) during 2 years’ observations before the
2015 Gorkha earthquake.
The shallow subsurface S-wave velocities of the
observation sites were investigated by the surface
wave method during installation of accelerometers
(Takai et al. 2015). The tested velocity of S-wave at
a depth of 10 m was over 700 m/s at the KTP site,
but it was less than 200 m/s at the other three sites.
These velocities are consistent with the geological
formations; KTP is located on a rock and TVU,
PTN, and THM are located on lake sediments in the
valley (Fig. 1a).
Ground accelerations
The fault size of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake estimated
by USGS (2015a) was about 200 km long and 150 km
wide (Fig. 1b), and it was associated with a large slip area
near the Kathmandu Valley. During data processing, we
first made a baseline correction by removing the mean
determined from a segment of the pre-event part of the
original record from the entire original acceleration record. Next, we made the sensor-response correction by
using the FFT deconvolution filter. The accelerograms
obtained after applying the sensor-response correction
are shown in Fig. 2 along with those from the KATNP
(Kanti Path, Kathmandu) station, which is managed by
United States Geological Survey (USGS) (the records of
KATNP lack absolute timing).
The largest peak ground acceleration (PGA, 241 cm/s2
)
was recorded on the EW component at the rock site KTP,
and the peak amplitude of the horizontal components was
250 cm/s2 at this station. This large PGA was due to isolated short-period waves at about 30 s from the origin time.
The horizontal PGA values were compared with those predicted by two ground motion prediction equations
(GMPEs) for ground accelerations. We found that the observed PGA values were smaller than those estimated by
the GMPEs (Si and Midorikawa 1999; Boore et al. 2014).
Anderson et al. (1986) pointed out that the observed PGA
values above the source area during the 1985 Michoacan,
Mexico, earthquake (Mw 8.0) were considerably smaller
(PGA, 100–200 cm/s2
) than those during the 1985 Valparaiso, Chile, earthquake (Mw 8.0). This may indicate that
the Mexico and Chile subduction zones are different from
each other in terms of the nature of the interplate coupling
as discussed by Houston and Kanamori (1986). The nature
of interplate coupling at the Nepal collision zone on the
other hand has to be studied in detail.

soft sedimentary sites. The waveform records at KATNP were provided by USGS (2015b)
Takai et al. Earth, Planets and Space (2016) 68:10 Page 3 of 8
The horizontal accelerograms at the sedimentary sites
had long duration with conspicuous long-period oscillations; however, the envelopes of oscillations in waveforms
differed from site to site. Conversely, the vertical accelerograms at all the sites were nearly the same and were
associated with no long-period oscillations. These observations are characterized by the site effects of the
Kathmandu Valley, that is, the valley response. Conspicuous long-period accelerations were also observed
within the lake zone in Mexico City during the 1985
Michoacan earthquake (Mw 8.0) (Anderson et al.
1986). The PGA values at both locations were comparable, while the predominant periods were somewhat
different; specifically, the periods in the Kathmandu
Valley were 3 to 5 s (see Figs. 3 and 4), while those in
Mexico City were 2 to 3 s. We should note that although both the conspicuous long-period accelerations
represent an effect of the lake sediments under the valleys, the exciting mechanisms may have been different
because the fault distance of the Kathmandu Valley was
about 10 km, whereas the relevant distance in Mexico
City was about 300 km; therefore, the incoming wave
fields into the two valleys were different from each
other. It is well known that the long-period accelerations
caused the collapse of, or severe damage to, many tall
buildings in the lake zone in Mexico City (Anderson et al.
1986). Fortunately, in the case of the Gorkha earthquake,
there were no high-rise or base-isolated buildings with the
long natural period in and around the Kathmandu Valley.
The original array data are provided as Additional files
1, 2, 3, and 4.
Ground velocities
We derived the velocity waveforms by integrating the
sensor-response corrected accelerograms with a linear acceleration method in the time domain (Fig. 3). The highest
peak ground velocity (PGV, 99 cm/s) was given by the NS
component record at TVU, and the peak amplitude of the
horizontal components was 108 cm/s at this station. We
then compared the observed PGV values with those predicted by the GMPEs in the same manner as that for the
PGA values. While the observed PGA values were smaller
than the predicted ones, the observed PGV values were
slightly larger than the predicted ones.
The velocity waveforms on the NS and UD components observed at the rock site KTP displayed the typical
velocity pulse ground motions; the arrival time of the
velocity pulses roughly corresponded to the S-wave arrival time from the hypocenter. They showed a singlesided velocity pulse with a width of about 6 s, while the
EW component showed a double-sided pulse with a
period of about 10 s. The ground velocities at KKN4
obtained from the high-rate (5-Hz sampling) GPS record
(Galetzka et al. 2015) had waveforms similar to those
observed at KTP, while the amplitudes of the KKN4
velocity pulses were about 1.4 times larger than those of
the KTP velocity pulses; KKN4 is a rock site in Kakani
located northwest of Kathmandu as shown in Fig. 1. The

velocity pulse and pulse-like ground motions observed
near surface of the faults can be considered to be the effect of the forward rupture directivity or the tectonic offset
(e.g., Loh et al. 2000; Mavroeidis and Papageorgiou 2003;
Hisada and Bielak 2003; Baker 2007; Dreger et al. 2011).
The Kathmandu Valley is located at a very close distance
(~10 km) from the rupture area, and large slip areas likely
exist near the valley (Galetzka et al. 2015). Furthermore,
the displacement waveforms derived from the velocity
pulses showed a monotonic step, as shown in Fig. 5. These
facts demonstrate that the observed velocity pulses were
the result of static displacement for the tectonic offset.
The UD component ground velocities at the sedimentary sites were nearly the same as those observed at the
Fig. 4 Fourier amplitude spectra and spectral ratios. The Fourier amplitude spectra of the ground velocities shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel). The ratios of

rock site KTP. In contrast, the horizontal ground velocities at the sedimentary sites had long duration with conspicuous long-period oscillations; we pointed out these
features for the accelerograms discussed in the previous
section (Fig. 2). Assuming that the KTP (rock site)
ground velocities represent incoming wave fields into
the Kathmandu Valley, we can consider the large ground
velocities at the sedimentary sites in Fig. 3 to be the
long-period (3–5 s) valley response. Here, we perform a
simple examination of the long-period valley response in
the frequency domain. The upper panel in Fig. 4 displays
the Fourier amplitude spectra of the ground velocities
shown in Fig. 3; we classified the spectra into three
components in order to compare one another’s spectral
shape for a given component. The lower panel in Fig. 4
shows the Fourier amplitude spectral ratios of the
sedimentary site spectra to the rock site spectrum for
each component; these figures correspond to the valley
response in the frequency domain for a given site. From
examination of Figs. 3 and 4, we found that the longperiod valley response had the following features: (1) the
horizontal valley response was characterized by large
amplification (about 10) and prolonged oscillations, (2)
the predominant period and envelope shape of the
horizontal oscillation differed not only from site to site
but also between the NS and EW components at a given
site, and (3) the vertical valley response had no amplification and no prolonged oscillations. These features
demonstrate that the long-period valley response of the
Kathmandu Valley is considerably complicated, because
they cannot be understood with one-dimensional seismic
wave amplification. Previous studies indicated an uneven
basement topography of the valley with many undulations (Moribayashi and Maruo 1980; Paudyal et al. 2013)
which may result in a complicated response. In order to
understand the factors involved in the observed longperiod valley response of the Kathmandu Valley, we will
have to clarify the three-dimensional underground structure of the valley in addition to the dense strong-motion
observations in and around the valley.
Ground displacements
The ground velocities at KTP where the simple velocity
pulses were observed on the UD and NS components
were integrated to derive the displacement waveforms.
The KTP displacement waveforms are shown in Fig. 5,
together with those observed by the high-rate GPSs at
KKN4 and NAST (Khumaltar, Lalitpur) (Galetzka et al.
2015); these locations are shown in Fig. 1. Here, the
horizontal components were rotated to the fault-normal
(N205E) and fault-parallel (N115E) directions based on
the USGS fault model (USGS 2015a) in order to obtain a
reasonable interpretation of the Earth’s surface motion.
The derived displacements at KTP were characterized by
a monotonic step (also including the contributions of
dynamic phases) on the fault-normal and UD components. They showed permanent displacements of 135 cm
in the fault-normal direction and 63 cm in the upward
direction (the vector sum was 149 cm), while there was
a negligible permanent displacement in the fault-parallel
direction. The displacement waveforms at KTP were
similar to those at the rock site KKN4 for the three
components. However, their permanent deformation
values were different; the values at KKN4 were larger
than those at KTP because the KKN4 site was closer to
the large slip area (Galetzka et al. 2015). The UD displacement and permanent deformation at the sedimentary site NAST were similar to those at KTP. However,
the horizontal displacement waveforms at NAST were
different from those at KTP; the long-period oscillations
observed at NAST resulted from the valley response as
mentioned in the previous section. In spite of the
contamination by the valley response, the horizontal
permanent deformation values at NAST did not greatly
differ from those at KTP; the distance between NAST
and KTP was only 6 km. These pieces of evidence indicate that the displacement waveforms at KTP derived
from the accelerograms produced reliable motion for the
Earth’s surface.
Conversely, the ground displacements derived from
the accelerograms at our sedimentary sites and KATNP
showed different waveforms than those of KTP. Although the UD displacements had similar waveforms
and permanent deformations as those at the rock site
KTP, the horizontal displacements showed considerable
drifts. According to Boore (2001), the source of the drifts
was likely the shift in the zero level due to tilting (either
dynamic or permanent) in the instruments; however, the
effect of tilt on the vertical components was much
smaller. These observations demonstrate that the highrate GPS waveforms captured the ground displacements
better than the horizontal accelerograms at the sedimentary sites where the horizontal long-period ground
motions were largely amplified, as shown in Fig. 3.
Horizontal velocity response spectra
Finally, to discuss the destructive power of observed
strong ground motions for buildings, we calculated horizontal velocity response spectra (h = 0.05); the horizontal
response spectrum was obtained based on the maximum
of the vector sum of the two horizontal-component response histories for a specific natural period. Figure 6
shows the horizontal velocity response spectra for the
five sites in the Kathmandu Valley. In this figure, the two
notable response spectra TKT (Takatori, Kobe, Japan)
and TCU068 (Shigang District, Taichung, Taiwan) are
also shown; these were derived from records observed at
the near-surface fault. The ground velocity at TKT
Takai et al. Earth, Planets and Space (2016) 68:10 Page 6 of 8
showed pulse-like motion with a large PGV of 161 cm/s
during the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan; the pulse-like
motion was caused by the directivity effect (Kamae and
Irikura 1998). The ground velocity at TCU068 showed a
velocity pulse with a large PGV of 400 cm/s and a long
pulse width of 8 s during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in
Taiwan; the velocity pulse was caused by fling-step motion
(Bolt and Abrahamson 2003). These records are frequently used for building structure assessments of pulse
motion (e.g., Hall et al. 1995; Kalkan and Kunnath 2006).
First, we compare the two response spectra for KTP
and TCU068, which were derived from the velocity
pulses. The TCU068 spectrum had a large peak at a
period of 10 s, which was several times larger than the
KTP peak at 6 s; this was due to the difference in amplitude and width of the two pulses. The spectral peaks for
the sedimentary sites (TVU, PTN, THM, and KATNP)
were considerably larger than that for the rock site KTP
in the period range of 3 to 5 s. Furthermore, we should
point out that these peaks, except for the one at PTN,
were larger than the two notable response spectra in the
period range of 3 to 5 s. These were due to the longperiod valley response, as mentioned in the previous
section. In general, we may conclude that the horizontal
ground motions at the sedimentary sites had enough
destructive power to damage high-rise buildings which
have natural periods of 3 to 5 s.
Concluding remarks
Since the capital city of Kathmandu in Nepal is located
on a sediment-filled valley and was located at a very
close distance to the fault plane of the 2015 Gorkha
earthquake, a wealth of new information on strong
ground motions was captured there. At the rock sites,
simple velocity pulses were observed on the NS and UD
components; these were the result of the tectonic offset.
At the sedimentary sites, although velocity pulses were
also observed on the vertical component, the horizontal
ground velocities showed largely amplified and prolonged long-period oscillations compared with the rock
site motions; these resulted from the valley response.
Finally, we found that the horizontal long-period oscillations had enough destructive power to damage high-rise
buildings. It will be important for us to understand the factors involved in the long-period valley response observed in
the Kathmandu Valley based on the three-dimensional
velocity structure of the valley in future studies.
